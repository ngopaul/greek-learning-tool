The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh struck Gaza.
Thus says Jehovah, / See, waters are rising up from the north / And will become an overflowing stream; / And they will overflow the land and all that fills it, / The city and those who dwell in it; / And men will cry out, / And every inhabitant of the land will howl.
At the sound of the stamping of the hooves of his stallions, / At the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, / The fathers will not turn back for their children, / Because of the feebleness of their hands,
Because of the day which is coming, / To destroy all the Philistines, / To cut off from Tyre and Sidon / Every helper who survives; / For Jehovah will destroy the Philistines, / The remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.
Baldness has come upon Gaza; / Ashkelon has been cut off. / O remnant of their valley, / How long will you cut yourself?
Alas, O sword of Jehovah, / How long until you are quiet? Put yourself into your sheath; / Rest and be still.
How can it be quiet, / When Jehovah has commanded it? / Against Ashkelon and against the seacoast--/ There He has appointed it.
