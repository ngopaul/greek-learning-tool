Concerning Moab: / Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: / Woe to Nebo, for it is destroyed; / Kiriathaim is put to shame; it is captured; / The lofty retreat is put to shame and dismayed.
The praise of Moab is no more; / In Heshbon they have devised evil against her, saying: / Come and let us cut her off from being a nation. / You also, O Madmen, will be brought to silence; / A sword will go after you.
The sound of a cry from Horonaim, / Desolation and great destruction!
Moab is destroyed; / Her young have caused a cry to be heard.
For by the ascent of Luhith / Continual weeping will go up; / For by the descent of Horonaim / They have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.
Flee, save your life, / And be like a shrub in the wilderness.
For because of your trust in your works and in your treasures, / You also will be captured; / And Chemosh will go forth into exile; / His priests and his princes together.
And a destroyer will come to every city, / And no city will escape; / The valley will also perish, / And the plateau will be destroyed, / As Jehovah has said.
Give wings to Moab, / That she may fly and go away; / And her cities will become a waste, / Without inhabitant in them.
Cursed is he who does the work of Jehovah negligently, / And cursed is he who keeps his sword from blood.
Moab has been at ease from his youth; / And he is settled on his lees / And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel; / Nor has he gone into exile. / Therefore his taste remains in him, / And his scent is not changed.
Therefore indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will send pourers to him, and they will pour him out and empty his vessels and shatter his jars.
And Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.
How can you say, We are mighty men / And valiant men for war?
Moab has been destroyed, / And its cities have gone up in smoke, / And its choice young men have gone down to slaughter, / Declares the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.
The calamity of Moab is near to coming, / And his affliction hastens quickly.
Lament for him, all who are around him / And all who know his name; / Say, How the strong rod is broken, / The glorious staff.
Come down from glory and sit in thirst, / O daughter who dwells in Dibon, / For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you; / He has destroyed your strongholds.
Stand by the way and watch, / O inhabitant of Aroer; / Ask him who flees and her who escapes, / And say, What has happened?
Moab is put to shame, for it is shattered. / Howl and cry out; / Declare by the Arnon / That Moab is devastated.
And judgment has come upon the land of the Plateau, on Holon and on Jahzah and on Mephaath
And on Dibon and on Nebo and on Beth-diblathaim
And on Kiriathaim and on Beth-gamul and on Beth-meon
And on Kerioth and on Bozrah and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.
The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, declares Jehovah.
Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against Jehovah; so Moab will wallow in his vomit and will also be in derision.
For was not Israel a derision to you? Or was he found among thieves? For as often as you speak of him, you shake your head.
Leave the cities and dwell in the rock, / O inhabitants of Moab, / And be like a dove who nests / On the sides of the mouth of the pit.
We have heard of the pride of Moab--/ He is extremely proud--/ Of his loftiness and his pride and his arrogance / And of the haughtiness of his heart.
I know of his insolence, declares Jehovah; / His boastings are all untrue; / They have accomplished nothing.
Therefore I will wail for Moab, / I will even cry out for all Moab; / There will be mourning for the men of Kir-heres.
With more than the weeping of Jazer / I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah. / Your shoots have crossed over to the sea; / They have reached as far as the sea, to Jazer; / On your summer fruit and on your vintage / The destroyer has fallen.
Rejoicing and exultation are taken away / From the fruited field and from the land of Moab. / And I have caused the wine from the wine presses to cease; / No one will tread them with the harvest shout; / The harvest shout will be no harvest shout.
From the cry of Heshbon as far as Elealeh, even as far as Jahaz, they have uttered their voice, from Zoar as far as Horonaim and to Eglath-shelishiyah; for even the waters of Nimrim will become a devastation.
And I will bring to an end in Moab the one who offers up in high places and burns incense to his gods, declares Jehovah.
Therefore My heart will moan for Moab like flutes; for the men of Kir-heres My heart will also moan like flutes. As a result, the abundance he has produced has perished.
For every head is bald, and every beard is shaved off; there are cuts on all the hands, and sackcloth on the loins.
On all the roofs of Moab and in her open squares there is wailing everywhere, for I have broken Moab like a vessel which no one desires, declares Jehovah.
How it is shattered! they howl. How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become a derision and a terror to all who are around him.
For thus says Jehovah, / One will swoop down like an eagle / And spread its wings against Moab.
Kerioth is captured, / And the strongholds are seized, / And the heart of the mighty men of Moab in that day / Will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
And Moab will be destroyed from being a people, / Because he magnified himself against Jehovah.
Dread, pit, and snare / Are upon you, O inhabitant of Moab, / Declares Jehovah.
He who flees from dread / Will fall into the pit, / And he who comes up out of the pit / Will be taken in the snare; / For I will bring upon her, upon Moab, / The year of their punishment, declares Jehovah.
In the shadow of Heshbon / Those who flee stand without strength; / For fire has gone forth from Heshbon / And a flame from the midst of Sihon; / And it has consumed the corner of Moab / And the top of the head of the sons of tumult.
Woe to you, O Moab! / The people of Chemosh have perished, / For your sons have been taken captive, / And your daughters have gone into captivity.
But I will turn again the captivity of Moab / In the last days, declares Jehovah. / Thus far is the judgment of Moab.
