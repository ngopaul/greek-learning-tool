Concerning the children of Ammon: / Thus says Jehovah, / Does Israel have no sons? / Or has he no heir? / Why has Malcam possessed Gad, / And why do his people dwell in his cities?
Therefore indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, / When I will cause the alarm of war to be heard / Against Rabbah of the children of Ammon. / And it will become a mound of desolation, / And its villages will be burned with fire. / And Israel will dispossess those who dispossess him, / Says Jehovah.
Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai has been destroyed; / Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah. / Gird yourselves with sackcloth and wail, / And run to and fro among the enclosures; / For Malcam will go into exile, / Together with his priests and his princes.
Why do you boast in your valleys? / Your valley is flowing away, / O apostate daughter, / Who trusts in her treasures, saying, / Who will come against me?
I will bring dread upon you, / Declares the Lord Jehovah of hosts, / From all around you; / And each one will be driven out headlong, / And no one will gather him who flees.
But afterward I will turn again / The captivity of the children of Ammon, / Declares Jehovah.
Concerning Edom: / Thus says Jehovah of hosts, / Is there no more wisdom in Teman? / Has counsel perished from those who understand? / Is their wisdom spent?
Flee, turn back, dwell in hidden places, / O inhabitants of Dedan, / For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him / At the time I punish him.
If the grape gatherers came to you, / Would they not leave gleanings? / If thieves came by night, / Would they not destroy only enough for themselves?
But I have stripped Esau bare; / I have exposed his secret places, / And he is not able to conceal himself. / His seed is destroyed, and his brothers and his neighbors; / And he is no more.
Leave your orphans behind; I will preserve them alive, / And let your widows trust in Me.
For thus says Jehovah, Those whose judgment was not to drink the cup will certainly drink it. And will you by any means be left unpunished? You will not be left unpunished, for you will certainly drink it.
For I have sworn by Myself, declares Jehovah, that Bozrah will become a waste, a reproach, a ruin and a curse; and all her cities will become eternal desolations.
I have heard a report from Jehovah, / And an envoy is sent among the nations, saying, / Gather yourselves together, and come against her, / And arise for war.
For, indeed, I have made you small among the nations, / Despised among men.
Your terribleness, the pride of your heart, / Has beguiled you, / O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, / Who grasp the height of the hill. / Though you make your nest as high as an eagle's, / I will bring you down from there, declares Jehovah.
And Edom will become an astonishment; everyone who passes by her will be astonished and will hiss at all her wounds.
As when Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown with its neighbors, says Jehovah, no one will dwell there, nor will a son of man sojourn in her.
Indeed, one will come up like a lion from the majesty of the Jordan against a secure habitation, for I will suddenly make them run away from her; and whoever is chosen I will appoint over her. For who is like Me? And who can appoint Me a time? And who is that shepherd who can stand before Me?
Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah, which He purposed against Edom, and His thoughts, which He has thought against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they will drag them off, the little ones of the flock; surely He will make their habitation a desolation because of them.
The earth quaked at the sound of their fall. There is a cry; the sound of it has been heard in the Red Sea.
Indeed, He will mount up and swoop down like an eagle, and spread out His wings over Bozrah; and the heart of the mighty men of Edom in that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
Concerning Damascus: / Hamath and Arpad are put to shame / Because they have heard an evil report. / They melt; anxiety is on the sea; / It cannot be quiet.
Damascus has become feeble; / She has turned to flee, / And panic has taken hold of her; / Pain and anguish seize her, / Like a woman giving birth.
How the city of praise is not forsaken, / The town of My joy.
Therefore her young men will fall in her open squares, / And all the men of war will be silenced in that day, declares Jehovah of hosts.
And I will set fire to the wall of Damascus, / And it will consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.
Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon struck down: Thus says Jehovah: / Arise, go up against Kedar, / And destroy the children of the east.
And they will take away their tents and their flocks; / Their curtains and all their vessels / And their camels they will carry away for themselves, / And they will call out to one another, Terror is on every side!
Flee, wander far away, dwell in hidden places, / O inhabitants of Hazor, declares Jehovah; / For Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon / Has taken counsel against you / And has devised a plan against you.
Arise, go up against a nation without care, / One that dwells securely, declares Jehovah. / It has no gates and bars; / They dwell alone.
And their camels will become plunder, / And the multitude of their livestock spoil; / And I will scatter those who cut the corners of their hair into every wind, / And I will bring their calamity from every side of them, / Declares Jehovah.
And Hazor will become a habitation of jackals, / An eternal desolation; / No one will dwell there; / Neither will a son of man sojourn in it.
The word of Jehovah which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the king of Judah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of hosts, / I am about to break the bow of Elam, / The chief part of their might.
And I will bring against Elam four winds / From the four ends of the heavens, / And I will scatter them into all these winds, / And there will not be a nation / To which those who are driven out from Elam will not go.
And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies / And before those who seek their life; / And I will bring evil upon them, / Even My burning anger, declares Jehovah. / And I will send the sword after them, / Until I make an end of them.
And I will set My throne in Elam, / And I will destroy king and princes from there, / Declares Jehovah.
But in the last days, / I will turn again the captivity of Elam, / Declares Jehovah.
