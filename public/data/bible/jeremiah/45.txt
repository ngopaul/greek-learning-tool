The word which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, concerning you, O Baruch:
You said, Woe is me! For Jehovah has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning and have not found rest.
Thus you shall say to him, Thus says Jehovah, What I have built I am about to tear down; and what I have planted I am about to pluck up, even this whole land.
And are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for I am about to bring evil upon all flesh, declares Jehovah, but I will give your own life to you as spoil in all places where you may go.
