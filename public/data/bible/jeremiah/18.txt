The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you hear My words.
So I went down to the potter's house, and he was there doing work at his wheel.
But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand; so he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good for the potter to make.
And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Am I not able to do with you, O house of Israel, as this potter does? declares Jehovah. Indeed, as the clay is in the hand of the potter, so you are in My hand, O house of Israel.
At the moment that I speak about a nation or about a kingdom, to pluck it up or to break it down or to destroy it,
And if that nation concerning which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it.
And at the moment that I speak about a nation or a kingdom, to build it up or to plant it,
And if it does evil in My sight by not listening to My voice, then I will repent of the good with which I said I would benefit it.
And now speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Look, I am forming evil against you and devising a plan against you. Return now, each one of you from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.
But they say, It is hopeless! For we will walk after our own devices and everyone will do according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.
Therefore thus says Jehovah, / Ask now among the nations, / Who has heard such things? / The virgin of Israel / Has done a very horrible thing.
Does the snow of Lebanon / Leave the rock of the field? / Or will the cold flowing waters / Coming from afar be dried up?
But My people have forgotten Me; / They burn incense to vanity, / And they have been stumbled in their ways / From the ancient paths / To walk on bypaths, / On a way which is not cast up,
To make their land an astonishment, / A thing to be hissed at forever. / Everyone who passes by will be astonished / And shake his head.
Like the east wind I will scatter them / Before the enemy; / I will show them My back and not My face / In the day of their calamity.
Then they said, Come, let us devise plots against Jeremiah; for the law will not perish from the priest or counsel from the wise man or a word from the prophet. Come, let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
Give heed to me, O Jehovah, / And listen to the voice of those who contend with me.
Shall evil be recompensed for good? / For they have dug a pit for my life. / Remember how I stood before You / To speak good for their sake, / To turn away Your wrath from them.
Therefore deliver up their children to famine, / And give them over to the power of the sword; / And let their wives become / Bereaved of child and be widows; / And let their men be slaughtered to death, / Their young men struck by the sword in battle.
Let a cry be heard from their houses / When You suddenly bring upon them a troop; / For they have dug a pit to capture me / And have hidden snares for my feet.
Yet You, O Jehovah, know / All their counsel against me for my death. / Do not be propitious to their iniquity, / And do not blot out their sin from before You; / But let them be overthrown before You; / Deal with them in the time of Your anger.
