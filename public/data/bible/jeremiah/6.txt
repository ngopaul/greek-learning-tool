Seek refuge, O children of Benjamin, / From the midst of Jerusalem; / And blow the trumpet in Tekoa / And raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; / For evil looks down from the north, / And great destruction.
The comely and delicate one, / The daughter of Zion, I will cut off.
Shepherds will come to her / With their flocks; / They will pitch tents against her all around; / They will feed each one in his place.
Prepare war against her; / Rise up, and let us go up at noon. / Woe to us, for the day has declined, / For the shadows of evening are lengthening.
Rise up, and let us go up at night / And destroy her palaces.
For thus says Jehovah of hosts, / Cut down her trees and build up / A mound against Jerusalem. / This is the city to be punished; / In her midst there is only oppression.
As a cistern keeps its waters fresh, / So she has kept her wickedness fresh. / Violence and destruction are heard in her; / Sickness and wounds are always before Me.
Be admonished, O Jerusalem, / Lest My desire for you depart, / Lest I make you a desolation, / An uninhabited land.
Thus says Jehovah of hosts, / They will thoroughly glean like a vine / The remnant of Israel; / Pass your hand again over the branches / Like a grape gatherer.
To whom shall I speak and testify, / That they may hear? / Indeed, their ear is uncircumcised, / And they are unable to listen. / See, the word of Jehovah has become a reproach to them; / They have no delight in it.
Yet I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; / I am weary of holding it in. / Pour it out upon the children in the street / And upon the assembly of the young men together; / For even the husband with the wife will be taken; / The old man, with the one who is full of days.
And their houses will be turned over to others, / Fields and wives together; / For I will stretch out My hand / Over the inhabitants of the land, / Declares Jehovah.
For from the least of them to the greatest of them, / Everyone is wresting unjust gain; / And from the prophet to the priest, / Everyone is dealing falsely.
And they have healed / The brokenness of My people slightly, / Saying, Peace, peace; / Although there is no peace.
Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? / They were not at all ashamed; / They did not even know to blush. / Therefore they will fall with those who fall; / At the time I punish them, they will stumble, / Says Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah, / Stand by the ways and see, / And ask for the ancient paths; / Ask where the good way is, and walk in it; / And you will find rest for your souls. / But they said, We will not walk in it.
So I set watchmen over you, saying, / Listen to the sound of the trumpet. / But they said, We will not listen.
Therefore hear, O nations, / And understand, O assembly, / What I will do to them.
Listen, O earth; I am now bringing evil / On this people, / The fruit of their thoughts; / Because they have not listened to My words, / And they have also rejected My law.
For what purpose does frankincense come to Me from Sheba, / And sweet cane from a distant land? / Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, / And your sacrifices are not pleasing to Me.
Therefore thus says Jehovah, / I am now laying before this people stumbling blocks, / And fathers and sons together / Will stumble against them; / A neighbor and his friend will perish.
Thus says Jehovah, / See, a people is coming from the land of the north, / And a great nation is stirring from the uttermost parts of the earth.
They grasp bow and spear; / They are cruel and have no mercy; / Their voice roars like the sea; / And they ride upon horses, / Set in array as a man for battle / Against you, O daughter of Zion.
We have heard its report; / Our hands are feeble; / Distress has seized us, / Pain like a woman in childbirth.
Do not go out into the field, / And do not walk on the road; / For the enemy has a sword; / Terror is on every side.
O daughter of my people, gird yourself in sackcloth / And roll in ashes; / Mourn as for an only son, / A most bitter wailing; / For suddenly the destroyer / Will come upon us.
I have set you as a trier among My people, as a fortress, / That you may know and try their way.
All of them are most rebellious, / Going about as slanderers; / They are bronze and iron; / All of them act corruptly.
The bellows are burned; / The lead is consumed by the fire; / The refining continues in vain, / For the wicked are not removed.
Men will call them rejected silver, / Because Jehovah has rejected them.
