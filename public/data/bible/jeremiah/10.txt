Hear the word which Jehovah speaks to you, O house of Israel.
Thus says Jehovah, / Do not learn the way of the nations, / And do not be terrified by the signs of the heavens, / Although the nations are terrified by them.
For the customs of the peoples are vanity, / Because their god is a tree cut from the forest, / The work of the hands of a craftsman with an axe.
He adorns it with silver and with gold; / They fasten it with nails and hammers / So that it cannot totter.
They are like a post in a cucumber field, / And they cannot speak; / They must be carried / Because they cannot walk. / Do not be afraid of them, / For they cannot do evil, / And neither is it in them to do good.
There is none like You, O Jehovah; / You are great, / And Your name is great in might.
Who would not fear You, / O King of the nations? / For it befits You, / For among all the wise of the nations / And in all their kingdoms / There is none like You.
But they are altogether stupid and foolish; / The instruction of their idols is mere wood.
Beaten silver / Is brought from Tarshish, / And gold from Uphaz, / The work of a craftsman / And of the hands of a goldsmith. / Their clothing is blue and purple; / All of them are the work of skillful men.
But Jehovah is the true God; / He is the living God and the eternal King. / At His wrath the earth quakes, / And the nations cannot endure His indignation.
Thus you shall say to them, The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth, these will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.
It is He who made the earth by His power, / Who established the world by His wisdom, / And by His understanding He stretched out the heavens.
When He utters His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, / And He causes the vapors to rise from the ends of the earth; / He makes lightning for the rain / And brings forth wind from His treasuries.
Every man is stupid, without knowledge; / Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idol; / For his molten image is falsehood, / And there is no breath in them.
They are vanity, the work of delusion; / At the time of their punishment they will perish.
The Portion of Jacob is not like these; / For He is the One who formed everything, / And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; / Jehovah of hosts is His name.
Gather up your bundle from the ground, / O inhabitant under siege.
For thus says Jehovah, / I will sling out / The inhabitants of the land / At this time, / And I will bring distress on them, / That they may find it.
Woe is me because of my hurt! / My wound is grievous. / But I said, Truly this is my affliction, / And I must bear it.
My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken; / My children have gone from me and they are not; / There is no one who will spread out my tent again / And set up my curtains.
For the shepherds are stupid / And have not sought Jehovah; / Therefore they have not prospered, / And all their flock is scattered.
The sound of a report! Here it comes, / Even a great commotion from the land of the north, / To make the cities of Judah / A desolation, a habitation of jackals.
I know, O Jehovah, / That a man's way is not in himself; / It is not in the man who walks / To direct his step.
Correct me, O Jehovah, but in measure, / Not in Your anger lest You bring me to nothing.
Pour out Your wrath on the nations / Who do not know You / And upon the families / Who do not call upon Your name; / For they have devoured Jacob, yes, devoured him and brought him to an end, / And they have desolated his habitation.
