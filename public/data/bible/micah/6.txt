Hear now what Jehovah says: / Arise, contend before the mountains, / And let the hills hear your voice.
Hear, O mountains, Jehovah's contention, / And you enduring foundations of the earth; / For Jehovah has a contention with His people, / And with Israel He will dispute.
O My people, what have I done to you? / And with what have I wearied you? Testify against Me.
For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, / And from the slave house I redeemed you; / And I sent before you Moses, / Aaron, and Miriam.
O My people, remember now what Balak the king of Moab counseled, / And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, / From Shittim to Gilgal, / That you may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.
With what shall I come before Jehovah / And bow myself before the high God? / Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, / With one-year-old calves?
Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, / With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? / Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, / The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
He has declared to you, O man, what is good; / And what does Jehovah require of you, / But that you would execute justice and love mercy / And walk humbly with your God?
The voice of Jehovah cries out to the city, / And wisdom looks upon Your name. / Hear the rod and Him who appointed it.
Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, / And a scant measure that is abominable?
Shall I be pure with wicked balances / And with a bag of deceitful weights?
For the rich men of the city are full of violence, / And those who inhabit it speak falsehood, / And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
Thus I also have made you sick by striking you; / I have made you desolate because of your sins.
You will eat, but you will not be satisfied; / And your emptiness will remain in the midst of you; / And you will take away, / But you will not rescue, / And what you rescue I will give up to the sword.
You will sow, / But you will not reap; / You will tread olives, / But you will not anoint yourself with oil, / And the new wine, / But you will not drink wine.
For the statutes of Omri are kept, / And all the works of the house of Ahab; / And you walk in their counsels, / That I may make you a desolation, / And the inhabitants of the city a hissing; / And you will bear the reproach of My people.
