Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops; / He has laid a siege against us. / With a rod they strike on the cheek / The Judge of Israel.
(But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel; / And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.)
Therefore He will give them up until the time / When she who is in labor delivers the child; / Then the remainder of His brothers will return, / Along with the children of Israel.
And He will stand and feed His flock in the strength of Jehovah, / In the majesty of the name of Jehovah His God; / And they will abide, for now He will be great / Unto the ends of the earth.
And this One will be the peace. / When Assyria comes into our land / And when he treads in our palaces, / We will raise up against him seven shepherds / And eight princes of men.
And they will waste the land of Assyria with the sword / And the land of Nimrod at its entrances. / And He will save us from Assyria, / When he comes into our land / And when he treads in our border.
And the remnant of Jacob will be / In the midst of many peoples / Like dew from Jehovah, / Like abundant showers upon the herbage, / Which do not tarry for man / And do not wait for the sons of men.
And the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, / In the midst of many peoples, / Like a lion among the beasts of the forest, / Like a young lion among the flocks of sheep, / Who, if he should pass through, tramples under / And tears up, and there is none to deliver from him.
Your hand will be raised up against your adversaries, / And all your enemies will be cut off.
In that day, / Declares Jehovah, / I will cut off your horses from the midst of you / And will destroy your chariots.
And I will cut off the cities of your land / And will throw down all your strongholds.
And I will cut off the sorceries from your hand, / And you will not have soothsayers.
And I will cut off your idols / And your pillars from your midst; / And you will no longer worship / The work of your hands.
And I will pluck up your Asherahs from your midst, / And I will destroy your cities.
And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath / Upon the nations that have not listened.
