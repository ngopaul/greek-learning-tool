You are the children of Jehovah your God; you shall not cut yourselves nor shave your forehead for the dead.
For you are a holy people to Jehovah your God, and Jehovah has chosen you to be a people for His personal treasure, from among all the peoples which are upon the face of the earth.
You shall not eat any abominable thing.
These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat;
The deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, the mountain sheep.
And every animal that has a divided hoof, that is, has its hoof split in two, and that chews the cud among the animals, that you may eat.
However, these you shall not eat of those that chew the cud or of those that have a split hoof: the camel, the hare, and the hyrax; because although they chew the cud, they do not have a divided hoof; they are unclean to you.
And the pig, because although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud; it is unclean to you. You shall not eat of their flesh, nor shall you touch their carcasses.
These you may eat of all that are in the water: Anything that has fins and scales you may eat,
But anything that does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean to you.
You may eat any clean bird.
But these are what you shall not eat: the great vulture, the bearded vulture, and the black vulture;
The kite, the falcon, and the kite of every kind;
And all ravens of every kind;
The ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, and the hawk of every kind;
The little owl, the great owl, the white owl,
The pelican, the carrion vulture, the cormorant,
The stork, the heron of every kind, the hoopoe, and the bat.
And all flying insects are unclean to you; they shall not be eaten.
You may eat any clean flying animal.
You shall not eat any carcass; to the sojourner who is within your gates you may give it that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a holy people to Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
You must give a tenth of all the produce of your seed, which the field brings forth, year by year.
And you shall eat before Jehovah your God, in the place where He will choose to cause His name to dwell, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your fresh oil and the firstborn of your herd and flock, that you may learn to fear Jehovah your God always.
But if the way is so far away from you that you are not able to carry your tithe, because the place where Jehovah your God will choose to set His name is too far away from you when Jehovah your God has blessed you,
Then you shall exchange it for money and bind up the money in your hand, and you shall go to the place which Jehovah your God will choose.
And you shall exchange the money for anything that your soul desires, for oxen, for sheep, for wine, for strong drink, or for anything that your soul would like; and you and your household shall eat there before Jehovah your God and rejoice.
But you shall not forsake the Levite who is within your gates, for he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your produce for that year and lay it within your gates;
And the Levite shall come--for he has no portion nor inheritance with you--as well as the sojourner and the orphan and the widow who are within your gates; and they shall eat and be satisfied, so that Jehovah your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
