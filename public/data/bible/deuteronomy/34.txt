Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land: Gilead as far as Dan;
And all of Naphtali; and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh; and all the land of Judah as far as the sea beyond it;
And the Negev; and the Plain, that is, the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.
And Jehovah said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed I will give it. I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not go over there.
So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab according to the word of Jehovah.
And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows his burial site to this day.
And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor had his freshness left him.
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days; thus, the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed.
And Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel listened to him and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And there has not arisen a prophet since then in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,
For all the signs and the wonders which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, to all his servants, and to all his land,
And for all the mighty power and for all the great terror which Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
