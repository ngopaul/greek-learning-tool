A false balance is an abomination to Jehovah, / But a full weight is His delight.
When pride comes, then comes dishonor; / But wisdom is with the humble.
The integrity of the upright will guide them, / But the perverseness of the treacherous will destroy them.
Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, / But righteousness delivers from death.
The righteousness of the perfect man will make his way straight, / But the wicked man will fall by his own wickedness.
The righteousness of the upright will deliver them, / But the treacherous will be taken in their own craving.
When a wicked man dies, his expectation will perish; / And the hope of the strong perishes.
The righteous man is delivered out of trouble, / And the wicked man comes into it instead of him.
With his mouth the profane man destroys his neighbor, / But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered.
When it goes well with the righteous, the city exults; / And when the wicked perish, there is a ringing shout.
By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted, / But it is torn down by the mouth of the wicked.
He who despises his neighbor lacks sense, / But a man of understanding keeps silent.
He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets, / But he who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter.
Where no sound counsel is, the people fall; / But in the multitude of counselors there is safety.
He who is surety for a stranger will surely be troubled, / But he who hates giving pledges is secure.
A gracious woman lays hold of honor, / And violent men lay hold of riches.
The merciful man rewards his own soul, / But the cruel troubles his own flesh.
The wicked man earns deceitful wages, / But he who sows righteousness gets a true reward.
He who is steadfast in righteousness shall attain to life, / And he who pursues evil advances to his own death.
Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah, / But those who are perfect in their way are His delight.
Be assured: The evil man will not go unpunished; / But the seed of the righteous will be delivered.
Like a nose-ring of gold in a pig's snout, / So is a beautiful woman who is without discretion.
The desire of the righteous is only good, / But the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
There is one who scatters and increases yet more, / And there is one who withholds what is appropriate but ends up only in want.
The blessing soul will prosper, / And he who waters will also be watered himself.
As for him who withholds grain, the people will curse him; / But blessing will be upon the head of him who sells it.
He who diligently seeks good seeks favor; / But as for him who searches after evil, it will come to him.
He who trusts in his riches will fall, / But the righteous will flourish like the green leaf.
He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind, / And a fool will be servant to the wise in heart.
The fruit of the righteous man is a tree of life, / And he who is wise wins souls.
If the righteous man will be recompensed on the earth, / How much more the wicked man and the sinner!
