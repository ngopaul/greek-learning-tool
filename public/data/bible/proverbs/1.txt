The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, the king of Israel:
For knowing wisdom and instruction; / For discerning words of understanding;
For receiving instruction in wise conduct, / Righteousness, justice, and equity;
For giving prudence to the simple, / Knowledge and discretion to the young man;
That the wise man may hear and increase in learning, / And he who has understanding may acquire sound counsel;
For understanding proverb and figure, / The words of the wise and their difficult sayings.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; / Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
Hear, my son, the instruction of your father, / And do not reject the teaching of your mother;
For they will be a wreath of grace for your head / And ornaments for your neck.
My son, if sinners entice you, / Do not consent.
If they say, Come with us; let us lie in wait for blood; / Let us ambush the innocent without cause;
Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, / And whole, like those who go down into the pit.
We will find all manner of precious goods; / We will fill our houses with booty;
Throw in your lot with us; / We will all have one purse--
My son, do not walk with them on this way; / Keep your foot from their path.
For their feet run toward evil, / And they hasten to shed blood.
For in vain is the net spread / In the eyes of any bird;
Yet they lie in wait for their own blood; / They ambush their own lives!
Such are the ways of everyone greedy for gain; / It takes away the life of its owners.
Wisdom cries out in the street; / She utters her voice in the open squares.
At the head of the tumultuous street she cries; / At the entrance of the gates in the city she utters her sayings:
How long, O simple ones, will you love simpleness, / And will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, / And will fools hate knowledge?
Turn yourselves at my reproof--/ Immediately I will pour out my spirit on you; / I will make my words known to you.
Because I called and you refused; / I stretched out my hand and no one heeded,
And you neglected all my counsel / And would have none of my reproof;
I also will laugh at your calamity; / I will mock when what you dread comes,
When what you dread comes like a storm, / And your calamity comes like a whirlwind, / When distress and anguish come upon you.
Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; / They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.
Because they hated knowledge / And did not choose the fear of Jehovah,
And would have none of my counsel / And despised all my reproof;
They shall eat of the fruit of their own way / And be filled with their own devices.
For the turning away of the simple will kill them, / And the prosperity of the foolish will cause them to perish;
But he who listens to me will dwell securely / And will live at ease, without the dread of evil.
