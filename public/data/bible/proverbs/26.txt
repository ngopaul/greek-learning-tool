Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest, / So honor is not fitting for a fool.
Like the sparrow in its fluttering, like the swallow in its flying, / So a curse without cause does not alight.
A whip for the horse! A bridle for the donkey! / And a rod for the back of fools!
Do not answer a fool according to his folly, / Lest you also be like him.
Answer a fool according to his folly, / Lest he be wise in his own eyes.
He who sends a message by the hand of a fool / Cuts off his own feet and drinks violence.
Like the legs of the lame which hang down, / So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
Like one who binds a stone in a sling, / So is he who gives honor to a fool.
Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard, / So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
Like an archer who wounds everyone, / So is he who hires a fool or who hires those who pass by.
Like a dog that returns to its vomit / Is a fool who repeats his folly.
Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? / There is more hope for a fool than for him.
The sluggard says, There is a roaring lion on the way; / A lion is in the streets!
As the door turns upon its hinges, / So does the sluggard upon his bed.
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; / He gets weary by bringing it to his mouth again.
The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes / Than seven men who can answer discreetly.
He who passes by and meddles with strife that does not belong to him, / Is like one who takes a dog by the ears.
Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death,
So is the man who deceives his neighbor, / And says, Was I not joking?
For lack of wood the fire goes out, / And where there is no whisperer, contention quiets down.
As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, / So is a contentious man to kindle strife.
The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels, / And they go down into the innermost parts of one's being.
Burning lips and a wicked heart / Are like an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.
He who hates disguises it with his lips, / But he lays up deceit within him;
When he speaks graciously, do not believe him; / For there are seven abominations in his heart;
Though his hatred covers itself with guile, / His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly.
Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, / And he who rolls a stone, it will come back on him.
A lying tongue hates those it crushes, / And a flattering mouth works ruin.
