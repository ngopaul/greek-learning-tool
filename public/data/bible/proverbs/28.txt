The wicked flee when no man pursues, / But the righteous are as bold as a lion.
When a land revolts, it has many rulers; / But by him who has understanding and knowledge it endures.
A destitute man who oppresses the poor / Is like a driving rain which leaves no food.
Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, / But those who keep the law contend with them.
Evil men do not understand justice, / But those who seek Jehovah understand all things.
Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity / Than he who is perverse in his ways though he is rich.
Whoever keeps the law is an understanding son, / But he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.
He who increases his substance by interest and usury / Gathers it for him who is gracious to the poor.
He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, / Even his prayer is an abomination.
Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way / Will himself fall into his own pit, / But the perfect will inherit good.
The rich man is wise in his own conceit, / But the poor man who has understanding searches him out.
When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; / But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
He who covers his transgressions will not prosper, / But whoever confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.
Blessed is the man who always fears, / But he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity.
Like a roaring lion and a roving bear / Is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
The ruler who lacks understanding is also a great oppressor, / But he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.
A man who is burdened with a person's blood / Will be a fugitive until death; / Let no man support him.
Whoever walks uprightly will be delivered, / But he who is perverse in his ways will fall all at once.
He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, / But he who pursues worthless things will have plenty of poverty.
A faithful man will abound with blessings, / But he who makes haste to be rich will not go unpunished.
To have respect of persons is not good, / Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress.
A man who is envious hastens after wealth, / And does not know that want will come upon him.
He who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor / Than he who flatters with the tongue.
Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, / It is no transgression, / Is the companion of a man who destroys.
A greedy person stirs up contention, / But he who trusts in Jehovah will prosper.
He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, / But he who walks wisely will be delivered.
He who gives to the poor man will not lack, / But he who shuts his eyes will have many curses.
When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; / But when they perish, the righteous increase.
