Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; / And whoever errs by it does not become wise.
The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion; / He who provokes him to anger sins against his own life.
It is an honor for a man to keep away from strife, / But every fool rushes headlong into it.
The sluggard will not plow because of winter; / Therefore he will beg in harvest and have nothing.
Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, / But a man of understanding will draw it out.
Many a man will proclaim his own kindness, / But who can find a faithful man?
A righteous man who walks in his integrity, / Blessed are his children after him.
A king who sits on the throne of judgment / Scatters away all evil with his eyes.
Who can say, I have made my heart clean; / I am pure from my sin?
Differing weights and differing measures, / Both of them are an abomination to Jehovah.
Even a child makes himself known by his deeds, / Whether his work is pure and whether it is upright.
The hearing ear and the seeing eye--/ Jehovah has made both of them.
Do not love sleep, or else you will come to poverty; / Open your eyes, and be satisfied with bread.
It is bad, it is bad, says the buyer; / But when he has gone away, then he boasts in his purchase.
There is gold and an abundance of corals, / But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
Take his garment when he becomes surety for a stranger, / And hold the pledge when he becomes surety for foreigners.
The bread of falsehood is sweet to a man, / But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel.
Every plan is established by counsel, / And by sound counsel make war.
He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets; / Therefore do not associate with one who opens his lips wide.
Whoever curses his father or his mother, / His lamp will go out in deep darkness.
An inheritance gained hurriedly at the beginning / Will not be blessed in the end.
Do not say, I will recompense evil; / Wait for Jehovah, and He will save you.
Differing weights are an abomination to Jehovah, / And false scales are not good.
A man's steps are ordered by Jehovah; / How then can man understand his own way?
It is a snare to a man to rashly say, It is holy, / And after making the vows to begin to consider.
A wise king winnows the wicked / And drives the threshing wheel over them.
The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all the innermost parts of the inner being.
Lovingkindness and truth preserve the king, / And his throne is upheld by kindness.
The glory of young men is their strength, / And the honor of old men is gray hair.
Stripes that wound purge away evil, / And strokes reach the innermost parts of the inner being.
