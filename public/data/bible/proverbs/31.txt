The words of King Lemuel. The oracle which his mother taught him.
What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? / And what, O son of my vows?
Do not give your strength to women, / Nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; / Nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?
Lest they drink and forget what is decreed, / And pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
Give strong drink rather to one who is perishing, / And wine to the bitter in soul;
Let him drink and forget his poverty, / And remember his misery no more.
Open your mouth for the dumb, / And for the rights of all those who are passing away.
Open your mouth; judge righteously, / And minister justice to the poor and needy.
Who can find a worthy woman? / For her price is far above corals.
The heart of her husband trusts in her, / And he will have no lack of gain.
She does him good and not evil / All the days of her life.
She seeks wool and flax, / And delights to work with her hands.
She is like the merchant ships; / She brings her food from afar.
She rises also while it is still night / And gives food to her household, / And their task to her serving girls.
She considers a field and buys it; / With the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
She girds her loins with strength / And makes strong her arms.
She samples her merchandise to be sure it is good; / Her lamp does not go out by night.
She lays her hands to the distaff, / And her hands hold on to the spindle.
She stretches out her hand to the afflicted, / And she reaches out her hands to the needy.
She does not fear for her household when it snows, / For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
She makes coverings for herself; / Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
Her husband is known in the gates, / When he sits among the elders of the land.
She makes linen garments and sells them / And delivers girdles to the merchant.
Strength and dignity are her clothing, / And she happily looks forward to the time to come.
She opens her mouth with wisdom, / And the law of kindness is on her tongue.
She watches closely over the ways of her household / And does not eat the bread of idleness.
Her children rise up and call her blessed; / Her husband also, and he praises her, saying:
Many daughters have done worthily, / But you surpass them all.
Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; / But a woman who fears Jehovah, she will be praised.
Give her of the fruit of her hands, / And let her works praise her in the gates.
