The wise woman builds her house, / But the foolish one tears it down with her own hands.
He who walks in his uprightness fears Jehovah, / But he who is perverse in his ways despises Him.
In the mouth of a fool is a rod for his pride, / But the lips of the wise will preserve them.
Where no oxen are, the manger is clean, / But much increase comes by the strength of the ox.
A faithful witness will not lie, / But a false witness utters lies.
A scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none, / But knowledge comes easily to one who has understanding.
Go from the presence of a foolish man, / For you will not perceive in him the lips of knowledge.
The wisdom of the prudent man is to understand his way, / But the folly of fools is deceit.
A trespass offering mocks fools, / But among the upright there is good will.
The heart knows its own bitterness, / And a stranger does not share in its joy.
The house of the wicked will be destroyed, / But the tent of the upright will flourish.
There is a way which seems right to a man, / But the end of it is the ways of death.
Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful, / And the end of joy is grief.
The backslider in heart will be filled with his own ways, / And a good man will be satisfied from himself.
The simple man believes every word, / But the prudent man considers his steps.
A wise man fears and departs from evil, / But the fool is arrogant and is confident.
He who is quick to anger will deal foolishly, / And a man of wicked devices is hated.
The simple inherit folly, / But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
The evil bow down before the good, / And the wicked, at the gates of the righteous man.
The poor man is hated even by his own neighbor, / But the rich man has many friends.
He who despises his neighbor sins, / But happy is he who is gracious to the poor.
Do not they who devise evil go astray? / But lovingkindness and truth are with those who devise good.
In all labor there is profit, / But mere talk leads only to poverty.
The crown of the wise is their riches, / But the folly of fools is only folly.
A truthful witness delivers souls, / But he who utters lies causes deceit.
In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence, / And his children will have a place of refuge.
The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, / That one may turn aside from the snares of death.
In a multitude of people is the king's glory, / But in an absence of people is the ruin of the prince.
He who is slow to anger is of great understanding, / But he who has a hasty spirit exalts folly.
A tranquil heart is life to the flesh, / But envy is rottenness to the bones.
He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker, / But he who is gracious to the needy honors Him.
The wicked man is thrust down in his evildoing, / But the righteous man has a refuge when he dies.
Wisdom rests quietly in the heart of one who has understanding, / But in the inward part of fools it makes itself known.
Righteousness exalts a nation, / But sin is a reproach to any people.
The king's favor is toward a servant who acts prudently, / But his overflowing wrath will be toward him who causes shame.
