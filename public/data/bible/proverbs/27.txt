Do not boast about tomorrow, / For you do not know what a day may bring forth.
Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; / A foreigner, and not your own lips.
A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty, / But a fool's vexation is heavier than both of them.
Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming, / But who can stand before jealousy?
Open rebuke is better / Than love that is hidden.
Faithful are the wounds of a friend, / But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
The full soul loathes a honeycomb, / But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
Like a bird that wanders from her nest, / So is a man who wanders from his place.
Oil and perfume rejoice the heart; / So a man's counsel is sweet to his friend.
Do not forsake your own friend or your father's friend / To go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity: / Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far away.
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, / That I may answer him who reproaches me.
A prudent man sees evil and hides himself; / But the simple pass on and suffer punishment for it.
Take the garment of him who is surety for a stranger, / And hold one in pledge who is surety for a foreign woman.
He who blesses his friend with a loud voice, / Arousing him early in the morning, / It will be reckoned as a curse to him.
A continual dripping on a very rainy day / And a contentious woman are alike;
He who would restrain her restrains the wind, / And grasps oil with his right hand.
Iron sharpens iron; / So a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.
Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, / And he who takes care of his master will be honored.
As in water face reflects face, / So the heart of man reflects man.
Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, / And the eyes of man are never satisfied.
The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, / And a man is tried by the praise given him.
Though you pound a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, / His folly will not depart from him.
Know well the condition of your flocks, / And pay attention to your herds--
For riches are not forever, / Nor does a crown endure from generation to generation--
Then when the grass has disappeared, and the tender grass is seen, / And the herbs of the mountains have been gathered in,
The lambs will be for your clothing, / And the goats will bring the price of a field;
And there will be goats' milk enough for your food, / For the food of your household, / And for the sustenance for your maidens.
