My son, keep my words, / And treasure up my commandments within you.
Keep my commandments, and live; / And my teaching, like the pupil of your eye.
Bind them on your fingers; / Write them on the tablet of your heart.
Say to wisdom, You are my sister, / And call understanding your close friend,
That they may keep you from the strange woman, / From the adulteress who flatters with her words.
For at the window of my house / I looked out through my lattice,
And I saw among the simple ones, / I discerned among the youths, / A young man lacking sense,
Passing along the street near her corner; / And he takes the way to her house,
In the twilight, in the evening of the day, / In the deep of night and darkness.
And there comes a woman to meet him, / Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart.
She is rowdy and defiant; / Her feet do not stay at home--
Now in the street, now in the squares, / And at every corner she lies in wait.
And she grabs him and kisses him; / And with an impudent face she says to him,
I had to make offerings; / Today I have paid my vows.
Therefore I have come out to meet you, / To earnestly seek your presence; and I have found you.
I have decked my couch with coverings, / Colored spreads of the linen of Egypt;
I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, / Aloes, and cinnamon.
Come, let us drink our fill of love until the morning; / Let us delight ourselves with love.
For my husband is not at home; / He has gone on a long journey.
He has taken the money bag with him; / He will come home at the full moon.
With her great persuasiveness she beguiles him; / With her smooth talk she compels him.
He goes after her immediately, / As an ox goes to the slaughter, / Or as someone in fetters, to the correction of the fool,
Until an arrow pierces through his liver. / As a bird hastens to the snare, / So he does not know that this will cost him his life.
And now, my sons, listen to me, / And pay attention to the words of my mouth.
Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; / Do not stray into her paths.
For many are those whom she has brought down wounded, / And numerous are all who have been slain by her.
Her house is the way to Sheol, / Going down to the chambers of death.
