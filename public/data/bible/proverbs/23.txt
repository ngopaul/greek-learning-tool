When you sit to eat with a ruler, / Consider carefully who is before you;
And put a knife to your throat / If you are a man of great appetite.
Do not desire his delicacies, / For they are deceitful food.
Do not weary yourself to become rich; / Cease from your consideration of it.
When you set your eyes upon it, it is gone; / For wealth certainly makes itself wings, / Like an eagle that flies toward heaven.
Do not eat the bread of one who is envious, / And do not desire his delicacies;
For as he thinks within himself, so he is. / He says to you, Eat and drink; / But his heart is not with you.
You will vomit up the morsel which you have eaten, / And waste your pleasant words.
Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, / For he will despise the wisdom of your words.
Do not remove the ancient boundary marker, / Or go into the fields of the fatherless;
For their Redeemer is strong; / He will plead their cause against you.
Apply your heart to instruction, / And your ears to words of knowledge.
Do not withhold correction from a child; / If you beat him with the rod, he will not die.
If you beat him with the rod, / You will deliver his soul from Sheol.
My son, if your heart is wise, / My own heart will also rejoice;
My inward parts will also exult, / When your lips speak right things.
Do not let your heart envy sinners, / But live in the fear of Jehovah all day long;
For surely there is a latter end, / And your hope will not be cut off.
Listen, my son, and be wise, / And direct your heart in the way.
Do not be among those who get drunk with wine, / Among gluttonous eaters of flesh;
For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, / And drowsiness will clothe them with rags.
Listen to your father who begot you, / And do not despise your mother when she is old.
Buy truth, and do not sell it; / Buy wisdom and instruction and understanding.
The father of the righteous man will greatly exult, / And he who begets a wise child will rejoice in him.
Let your father and your mother rejoice, / And let her who bore you exult.
My son, give me your heart, / And let your eyes observe my ways.
For a harlot is a deep pit, / And an adulteress is a narrow well.
Indeed, she lies in wait as a robber, / And increases the number of the treacherous among men.
Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? / Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?
Those who linger late over wine, / Those who go to seek out mixed wines.
Do not look upon the wine when it is red, / When it sparkles in the cup, / When it goes down smoothly;
In the end it bites like a serpent, / And stings like an adder.
Your eyes will see strange things, / And your heart will utter perverse things;
And you will be like one who lies down while at sea, / Or like one who lies down at the top of a mast.
They struck me, you will say, but I was not hurt; / They beat me, but I did not feel it; / When will I awake? I will seek another drink.
