The plans of the heart belong to man, / But the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah.
All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes, / But Jehovah weighs the spirits.
Commit your works to Jehovah, / And your purposes will be established.
Jehovah has made everything for its own purpose, / Yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.
Every one who is proud in heart is an abomination to Jehovah; / Be assured: He will not be unpunished.
By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is expiated, / And by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil.
When a man's ways please Jehovah, / He causes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
Better is a little with righteousness, / Than great income with injustice.
A man's heart devises his way, / But Jehovah directs his steps.
A divine decision is on the lips of the king; / His mouth will not transgress in judgment.
A just balance and just scales are Jehovah's; / All the weights of the bag are His work.
It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness, / For the throne is established by righteousness.
Righteous lips are the delight of kings, / And they love one who speaks right.
The wrath of a king is as messengers of death, / But a wise man will appease it.
In the light of the king's countenance is life, / And his favor is like a cloud of the latter rain.
How much better it is to acquire wisdom than gold, / And to acquire understanding is to be chosen above silver.
The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; / He who keeps his way preserves his soul.
Pride goes before destruction, / And a haughty spirit before a fall.
It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, / Than to divide the spoil with the proud.
He who gives heed to the word will find good, / And blessed is he who trusts in Jehovah.
The wise in heart will be called discerning, / And the sweetness of speech increases persuasiveness.
Insight is a fountain of life to him who has it, / But the correction of fools is folly.
The heart of the wise man instructs his mouth / And adds persuasiveness to his lips.
Pleasant words are a honeycomb, / Sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.
There is a way which seems right to a man, / But the end of it is the ways of death.
The appetite of the laboring man labors for him; / For his mouth urges him on.
A worthless man digs up evil, / And on his lips there is a scorching fire.
A perverse man spreads strife, / And a whisperer separates close friends.
A man of violence entices his neighbor / And leads him in a way that is not good.
He who shuts his eyes does so to devise perverse things; / He who compresses his lips brings evil to pass.
The gray head is a crown of glory; / It will be found in the way of righteousness.
He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; / And he who rules his spirit, than he who captures a city.
The lot is cast into the lap, / But everything it decides is from Jehovah.
