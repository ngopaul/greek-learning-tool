Wisdom has built her house; / She has hewn out her seven pillars;
She has slaughtered her beasts; / She has mingled her wine; / She has also set her table;
She has sent forth her maidens; / She calls from the highest places of the city:
Whoever is simple, let him turn in here; / As for him who lacks sense, she says to him,
Come, eat of my bread, / And drink of the wine which I have mingled.
Forsake foolishness, and live, / And walk in the way of understanding.
He who corrects a scorner gets dishonor for himself, / And he who reproves a wicked man blemishes himself.
Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate you; / Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.
Impart something to a wise man, and he will become wiser still; / Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, / And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
For by me your days will be multiplied, / And the years of your life will be increased.
If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; / And if you are scornful, you alone will bear it.
The woman Foolishness is rowdy; / She is simple and knows nothing.
And she sits at the door of her house, / On a seat in the heights of the city,
To call to those who pass by, / Who go straight on their ways:
Whoever is simple, let him turn in here; / And as for him who lacks sense, she says to him,
Stolen waters are sweet, / And bread gotten in secret is pleasant.
But he does not know that the dead are there, / That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
