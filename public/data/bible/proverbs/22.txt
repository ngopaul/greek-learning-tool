A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, / And favor is better than silver and gold.
The rich and the poor have this in common: / Jehovah is the Maker of them all.
A prudent man sees evil and hides himself, / But the simple pass on and suffer punishment for it.
The reward of humility and the fear of Jehovah / Are riches and honor and life.
Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse; / He who guards his soul will keep far from them.
Train up a child according to the way he should go; / Even when he is old, he will not depart from it.
The rich man rules over the poor, / And the borrower is servant to the lender.
He who sows injustice will reap iniquity, / And the rod of his wrath will fail.
He who is generous will be blessed, / For he gives some of his bread to the poor.
Cast out the scorner, and contention will go out; / Indeed, strife and dishonor will cease.
He who loves pureness of heart / And whose speech is gracious will have the king as his friend.
The eyes of Jehovah preserve knowledge, / But He overthrows the words of the treacherous man.
The sluggard says, There is a lion outside! / I will be slain in the streets!
The mouth of strange women is a deep pit; / He with whom Jehovah is indignant will fall in there.
Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; / But the rod of correction will drive it far from him.
He who oppresses the poor to multiply his gain, / And he who gives to the rich will only come to want.
Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise, / And apply your heart to my knowledge;
For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you; / Let them be ready on your lips.
So that your trust may be in Jehovah, / I have made them known to you today, even to you.
Have I not written to you excellent things / Of counsels and knowledge,
To make you know the certainty of the words of truth, / That you may answer back words of truth to those who send you?
Do not rob the poor, because he is poor; / Nor oppress the afflicted in the gate;
For Jehovah will plead their cause, / And rob the life of those who rob them.
Make no friendship with a man who is given to anger, / And with a wrathful man do not go;
Lest you learn his ways / And get a snare for your soul.
Do not be one of those who give their hand as a pledge / Or one of those who are a surety for debts.
If you have nothing with which to pay, / Why should your bed be taken away from under you?
Do not remove the ancient boundary marker, / Which your fathers have set up.
Do you see a man skilled in his work? / He will stand before kings; / He will not stand before obscure men.
