A soft answer turns away anger, / But a grievous word stirs up anger.
The tongue of the wise utters knowledge well, / But the mouth of fools pours out folly.
The eyes of Jehovah are in every place, / Keeping watch on the evil and the good.
A soothing tongue is a tree of life, / But perverseness in it is a breaking of the spirit.
A fool despises his father's correction, / But he who regards reproof gets prudence.
In the house of the righteous man there is much treasure, / But in the income of the wicked there is trouble.
The lips of the wise disperse knowledge, / But the heart of fools does not do so.
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah, / But the prayer of the upright is His delight.
The way of the wicked man is an abomination to Jehovah, / But He loves one who pursues righteousness.
There is grievous correction for one who forsakes the way, / And he who hates reproof will die.
Sheol and Abaddon lie open before Jehovah. / How much more the hearts of the children of men!
A scorner does not love him who reproves him; / He will not go to the wise.
A joyful heart makes a cheerful countenance, / But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.
The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge, / But the mouth of fools feeds on folly.
All the days of the afflicted are evil, / But he who is of a cheerful heart has a continual feast.
Better is a little with the fear of Jehovah / Than great treasure and turmoil with it.
Better is a dinner of vegetables where love is / Than a fattened ox and hatred with it.
A wrathful man stirs up contention, / But he who is slow to anger quiets strife.
The way of the sluggard is like a hedge of thorns, / But the path of the upright is paved.
A wise son makes a father glad, / But a foolish man despises his mother.
Folly is joy to him who lacks sense, / But a man of understanding makes straight his going.
Where there is no counsel, plans are frustrated; / But in the multitude of counselors they are established.
A man has joy in the apt answer of his mouth; / And a word in its season, how good it is!
To the wise man the way of life leads upward, / That he may depart from Sheol below.
Jehovah will tear down the house of the proud, / But He will establish the territory of the widow.
Evil plans are an abomination to Jehovah, / But pleasant words are pure.
He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, / But he who hates bribes will live.
The heart of the righteous man ponders how to answer, / But the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.
Jehovah is far from the wicked, / But He hears the prayer of the righteous.
The light of the eyes rejoices the heart, / And good news makes the bones fat.
The ear that listens to the reproof of life / Will lodge among the wise.
He who ignores instruction despises his own soul, / But he who listens to reproof acquires understanding.
The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom, / And humility goes before honor.
