My son, if you receive my words / And treasure up my commandments within you,
Making your ear attentive to wisdom / And inclining your heart to understanding;
Indeed, if you cry out for discernment / And lift up your voice for understanding;
If you seek her like silver / And search for her like hidden treasures,
Then you will understand the fear of Jehovah / And find the knowledge of God.
For Jehovah gives wisdom; / From His mouth come knowledge and understanding;
He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; / He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,
Guarding the paths of justice / And keeping the way of His faithful ones.
Then you will understand righteousness and justice / And equity, indeed, every good path.
For wisdom will enter your heart, / And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
Discretion will watch over you; / Understanding will keep you:
To deliver you from the way of evil, / From the man who speaks perverse things,
From those who forsake the paths of uprightness / To walk in the ways of darkness,
Who rejoice in doing evil / And delight in the perverseness of evil,
Whose paths are crooked, / And who are devious in their ways;
To deliver you from the strange woman, / From the adulteress who flatters with her words,
Who forsakes the companion of her youth / And forgets the covenant of her God;
For her house sinks down to death, / And her paths lead to the dead;
None who go to her ever return, / Nor do they attain to the paths of life;
That you may walk in the way of good men / And keep the paths of the righteous;
For the upright will dwell in the land, / And the perfect will remain in it;
But the wicked will be cut off from the land, / And the treacherous will be uprooted from it.
