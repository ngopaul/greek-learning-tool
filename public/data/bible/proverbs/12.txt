Whoever loves correction loves knowledge, / But he who hates reproof is stupid.
A good man will obtain the favor of Jehovah, / But a man of wicked devices He will condemn.
A man will not be established by wickedness, / But the root of the righteous will not be moved.
A worthy woman is the crown of her husband, / But she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.
The thoughts of the righteous are just, / But the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.
The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, / But the mouth of the upright will deliver them.
The wicked are overthrown and are no more, / But the house of the righteous will stand.
A man will be praised according to his prudence, / But he who is of a perverse heart will be despised.
Better is he who is lightly esteemed and has a servant, / Than he who honors himself and lacks bread.
A righteous man regards the life of his beast, / But the inward parts of the wicked are cruel.
He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, / But he who pursues worthless things lacks sense.
The wicked man desires the catch of evil men, / But the root of the righteous yields fruit.
In the transgression of the lips there is a snare for the evil man, / But the righteous man will come out of trouble.
A man will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth, / And the result of man's deeds will be rendered to him.
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, / But a wise man listens to counsel.
A fool's anger is known at once, / But a prudent man conceals shame.
He who utters truth tells forth righteousness; / But a false witness, deceit.
There is one who speaks rashly like the piercings of a sword, / But the tongue of the wise brings healing.
The lip of truth shall be established forever, / But a lying tongue is only for a moment.
Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, / But counselors of peace have joy.
No harm will happen to the righteous man, / But the wicked are filled with trouble.
Lying lips are an abomination to Jehovah, / But those who deal faithfully are His delight.
A prudent man conceals knowledge, / But the heart of fools proclaims folly.
The hand of the diligent will rule, / But the slothful will be under forced labor.
Anxiety in the heart of a man weighs it down, / But a good word brings it joy.
The righteous man is a guide to his neighbor, / But the way of the wicked leads them astray.
The slothful man does not roast his game, / But the precious substance of men is to the diligent.
In the way of righteousness is life, / And in its pathway there is no death.
