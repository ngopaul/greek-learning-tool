Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it / Than a house full of feasting with strife.
A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame, / And will share in the inheritance among brothers.
The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, / But Jehovah tries the hearts.
An evildoer gives heed to wicked lips, / And a liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.
Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker; / He who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished.
Grandchildren are the crown of old men, / And the glory of children is their fathers.
Excellent speech is not fitting for a fool; / Much less are lying lips for a noble man.
A bribe is like a precious stone in the eyes of its possessor: / Wherever he turns, he prospers.
He who covers a transgression seeks love, / But he who repeats a matter separates close friends.
A rebuke strikes deeper into him who has understanding / Than a hundred stripes into a fool.
An evil man seeks only rebellion; / Therefore a cruel messenger will be sent against him.
Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man / Rather than a fool in his folly.
Whoever rewards evil for good, / Evil will not depart from his house.
The beginning of contention is like letting out water; / Therefore abandon strife before it breaks out.
He who justifies the wicked man, and he who condemns the righteous man, / Both of them are an abomination to Jehovah.
Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, / When he has no sense?
A friend loves at all times, / And a brother is born for adversity.
A man lacking sense gives his hand as a pledge / And becomes surety in the presence of his neighbor.
He who loves transgression loves strife; / He who raises high his entrance seeks destruction.
He who has a crooked heart finds no good, / And he who has a perverse tongue falls into evil.
He who begets a fool does so to his sorrow, / And the father of a fool has no joy.
A joyful heart is good medicine, / But a broken spirit dries up the bones.
A wicked man receives a bribe from the bosom, / To pervert the ways of justice.
Wisdom is before the face of him who has understanding, / But the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.
A foolish son is a grief to his father, / And bitterness to her who bore him.
To also punish the righteous man is not good, / Nor to strike nobles for their uprightness.
He who restrains his words has knowledge, / And he who is cool in spirit is one who has understanding.
Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise; / When he shuts his lips, he is counted prudent.
