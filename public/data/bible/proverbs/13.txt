A wise son hears his father's instruction, / But a scorner does not listen to rebuke.
A man will eat good from the fruit of his mouth, / But the desire of the treacherous is violence.
He who guards his mouth keeps his soul, / But he who opens wide his lips will have destruction.
The soul of the sluggard desires and has nothing, / But the soul of the diligent will be made fat.
A righteous man hates what is false, / But a wicked man is odious and is confounded.
Righteousness guards him who is blameless in the way, / But wickedness overthrows the sinner.
There is one who pretends to be rich yet has nothing; / There is one who pretends to be poor yet has great wealth.
The ransom of a man's life is his riches, / But the poor hears no threatening.
The light of the righteous rejoices, / But the lamp of the wicked goes out.
Through pride comes nothing but strife, / But wisdom is with those who receive counsel.
Wealth obtained by vanity will be diminished, / But he who gathers by labor increases it.
Hope deferred makes the heart sick, / But when what is desired comes, it is a tree of life.
Whoever despises the word brings destruction on himself, / But he who fears the commandment will be rewarded.
The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, / That one may turn aside from the snares of death.
Good understanding gives favor, / But the way of the treacherous is hard.
Every prudent man works with knowledge, / But a fool displays his folly.
A wicked messenger falls into evil, / But a faithful envoy brings healing.
Poverty and shame will come to him who refuses correction, / But he who regards reproof will be honored.
A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, / But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil.
He who walks with wise men will be wise, / But the companion of fools will be troubled.
Evil pursues sinners, / But good recompenses the righteous.
A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, / But the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous man.
The fallow ground of the poor yields much food, / But it is destroyed through injustice.
He who spares his rod hates his son, / But he who loves him chastens him early.
The righteous man eats to the satisfying of his soul, / But the belly of the wicked will lack.
