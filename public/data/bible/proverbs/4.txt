Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father, / And be attentive, that you may gain understanding;
For I give you good teaching; / Do not forsake my instruction.
For I was a son to my father, / Tender and the only beloved in the sight of my mother.
And he taught me and said to me, / Let your heart hold fast to my words; / Keep my commandments and live;
Get wisdom; get understanding; / Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; / Love her, and she will guard you.
The beginning of wisdom is this: / Get wisdom; and in all your getting, get understanding.
Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; / She will honor you if you embrace her.
She will give a garland of grace for your head; / A crown of beauty will she bestow on you.
Hear, my son, and receive my words, / And the years of your life will be many.
I have taught you in the way of wisdom; / I have led you in the paths of uprightness.
When you walk, your steps will not be hindered; / And when you run, you will not stumble.
Take hold of instruction; do not let go; / Guard her, for she is your life.
Do not enter the path of the wicked, / And do not walk in the way of the evil.
Avoid it; do not pass by it; / Turn away from it and pass on by.
For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; / And they are robbed of their sleep unless they cause someone to stumble.
For they eat the bread of wickedness / And drink the wine of violence.
But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, / Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.
The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; / They do not know what they stumble over.
My son, be attentive to my words; / Incline your ear to my sayings.
Do not let them depart from your sight; / Keep them in the midst of your heart.
For they are life to those who find them, / And healing to all their flesh.
Keep your heart with all vigilance, / For from it are the issues of life.
Put away from you crooked speech, / And put perverse talk far from you.
Let your eyes look directly ahead, / And let your gaze be straight in front of you.
Make straight the path of your feet, / And all your ways will be established.
Do not turn to the right or to the left; / Turn your foot away from evil.
