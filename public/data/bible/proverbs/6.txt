My son, if you have become a surety for your neighbor, / If you have given your hands as a pledge for a stranger,
You are snared by the words of your mouth; / You are caught by the words of your mouth.
Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, / Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor: / Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.
Do not give sleep to your eyes, / Nor slumber to your eyelids.
Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hunter's hand / And like a bird from the fowler's hand.
Go to the ant, you sluggard; / Consider its ways, and be wise,
Which, having no chief, / Officer, or ruler,
Prepares its food in summer / And gathers its sustenance in the harvest.
How long, sluggard, will you lie there? / When will you arise from your sleep?
A little sleep, a little slumber, / A little folding of the hands to rest,
And your poverty will come upon you like a robber, / And your want, like an armed man.
A worthless man, a wicked man, / Goes around with a perverse mouth,
Winking with his eyes, signaling with his feet, / Pointing with his fingers;
With perverseness in his heart, he is devising evil continually; / He injects discord.
Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; / In a moment he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.
There are six things that Jehovah hates; / Indeed, seven that are an abomination to His soul:
Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, / And hands that shed innocent blood,
A heart that devises wicked schemes, / Feet that hurry to run to evil,
A false witness who utters lies, / And one who injects discord among brothers.
My son, keep the commandment of your father, / And do not reject the teaching of your mother;
Bind them continually on your heart; / Tie them around your neck.
When you walk about, it will guide you, / When you lie down, it will watch over you; / And when you awake, it will talk with you.
For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light, / And the reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
To keep you from the evil woman, / From the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
Do not desire her beauty in your heart, / Nor let her catch you with her eyelids;
For the price of a harlot is a loaf of bread, / But the wife of another man hunts for the precious soul.
Can a man take fire in his bosom / And his clothes not be burned?
Can a man walk on hot coals / And his feet not be scorched?
So it is with him who goes in to his neighbor's wife; / No one who touches her will be unpunished.
The thief is not despised if he steals / To satisfy himself when he is hungry;
But if he is found out, he shall restore sevenfold; / He must give over all the substance of his house.
He who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense; / He who does it destroys his own soul.
He will find wounds and dishonor, / And his reproach will not be wiped away.
For jealousy is the rage of a man, / And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
He will not regard any ransom, / Nor will he be content if you give him great gifts.
