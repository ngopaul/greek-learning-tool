Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity / Than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.
Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge, / And he who makes haste with his feet sins.
The foolishness of a man subverts his way, / And his heart is indignant toward Jehovah.
Wealth adds many friends, / But the poor man is separated from his friend.
A false witness will not go unpunished, / And he who utters lies will not escape.
Many will entreat the favor of the generous man, / And every man is a friend to one who gives gifts.
All the brothers of the poor man hate him; / How much more do his friends go far from him! / He pursues them with words, but they are not there.
He who acquires sense loves his own soul; / He who keeps understanding will find good.
A false witness will not go unpunished, / And he who utters lies will perish.
Delicate living is not fitting for a fool; / Much less for a servant to rule over princes.
The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger, / And it is his glory to overlook a transgression.
The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, / But his favor is like dew upon the grass.
A foolish son is the ruin of his father, / And the contentions of a wife are a continual dripping.
House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, / But a prudent wife is from Jehovah.
Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep, / And the idle soul will suffer hunger.
He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul; / He who is careless of his ways will die.
He who has pity upon a poor man lends to Jehovah, / And He will repay him for his good deed.
Discipline your son, for there is hope; / But do not set your heart on destroying him.
A man of great wrath will bear the penalty; / For if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again.
Listen to counsel, and receive instruction, / That you may be wise at the end of your days.
There are many devices in a man's heart, / But it is the counsel of Jehovah that will stand.
What is desirable in a man is his kindness, / And a poor man is better than a liar.
The fear of Jehovah leads to life, / And he who has it will lodge in contentment; / He will not be visited with evil.
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, / And will not even bring it back to his mouth.
Strike a scorner, and the simple will learn prudence; / And reprove one who has understanding, and he will understand knowledge.
He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother / Is a son that causes shame and brings reproach.
Cease listening, my son, to instruction, / And you will stray from the words of knowledge.
A worthless witness mocks justice, / And the mouth of the wicked swallows up iniquity.
Judgments are prepared for scorners, / And blows for the back of fools.
