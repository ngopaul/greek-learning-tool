My son, do not forget my instruction, / But let your heart keep my commandments;
For length of days and years of life / And peace will they add to you.
Do not let lovingkindness and truth forsake you: / Bind them around your neck; / Write them upon the tablet of your heart.
Thus you will find favor and a reputation for fine understanding / In the sight of God and man.
Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, / And do not rely on your own understanding;
In all your ways acknowledge Him, / And He will make your paths straight.
Do not be wise in your own eyes; / Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil.
It will be healing to your body / And refreshment to your bones.
Honor Jehovah with your substance / And with the firstfruits of all your produce;
Then your barns will be filled with plenty, / And your vats will burst open with new wine.
My son, do not despise the chastening of Jehovah, / Nor be weary of His discipline;
For whom Jehovah loves He disciplines, / Even as a father, the son in whom he delights.
Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, / And the man who gains understanding.
For her profit is better than the profit of silver, / And her income is better than gold.
She is more precious than corals, / And nothing you desire compares with her.
Length of days is in her right hand; / In her left hand are riches and honor.
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, / And all her paths are peace.
She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her, / And happy are those who hold her fast.
Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; / He established the heavens by understanding;
By His knowledge the depths were broken open / And the skies drop down the dew.
My son, do not let these depart from your sight: / Keep sound wisdom and discretion;
And they will be life for your soul / And a graceful ornament for your neck.
Then you will walk on your way securely, / And your foot will not stumble.
When you lie down, you will not be afraid; / But you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.
Do not be afraid of sudden fear, / Nor of the destruction of the wicked when it comes;
For Jehovah will be your confidence, / And He will keep your foot from being caught.
Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, / When it is in the power of your hand to do so.
Do not say to your neighbor, Go, and come back; / And tomorrow I will give it--when you have it with you.
Do not devise harm against your neighbor, / While he lives securely beside you.
Do not strive with a man without cause, / If he has done you no harm.
Do not envy a man of violence, / And do not choose any of his ways;
For the perverse man is an abomination to Jehovah, / But His intimate counsel is with the upright.
The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked man, / But He blesses the dwelling place of the righteous.
To scorners He is scornful, / But to the humble He gives grace.
The wise will inherit honor, / But fools increase their own disgrace.
