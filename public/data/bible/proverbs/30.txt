The words of Agur the son of Jakeh. The oracle. / The man declares to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
Surely I am more stupid than any man, / And do not have a man's understanding;
And I have not learned wisdom, / Nor do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.
Who has ascended into heaven and descended? / Who has gathered the wind in His fists? / Who has wrapped up the waters in His garment? / Who has established all the ends of the earth? / What is His name, and what is His Son's name, if you know?
Every word of God is tried; / He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.
Do not add to His words, / Lest He reprove you and you be found a liar.
Two things I have asked of You; / Do not refuse me before I die:
Remove far from me falsehood and lies. / Give me neither poverty nor riches; / Feed me with the food that is my portion,
Lest I become full and deny You and say, Who is Jehovah? / Or lest I become poor and steal and profane the name of my God.
Do not slander a servant to his master, / Lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.
There is a generation that curse their father, / And do not bless their mother.
There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, / And yet are not washed from their filthiness.
There is a generation--oh how lofty are their eyes, / And their eyelids are raised arrogantly.
There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, / And their jaw teeth like knives, / To devour the afflicted from off the earth, / And the needy from among men.
The leech has two daughters, crying, Give, give. / There are three things that are never satisfied, / Indeed, four that do not say, Enough:
Sheol and the barren womb, / The earth that is not satisfied with water, / And the fire that does not say, Enough.
The eye that mocks his father / And despises to obey his mother, / The ravens of the valley will pick it out, / And the young eagles will eat it.
There are three things which are too wonderful for me, / Indeed four which I do not know:
The way of an eagle in the sky, / The way of a serpent upon a rock, / The way of a ship in the midst of the sea, / And the way of a man with a maiden.
This is the way of an adulterous woman: / She eats and wipes her mouth / And says, I have done no wickedness.
Under three things the earth quakes, / And under four, it cannot bear up:
Under a servant when he is king, / And a fool when he is filled with food;
Under a hated woman when she gets married, / And a servant girl who is heir to her mistress.
Four things are small on the earth, / But they are exceedingly wise:
The ants are a clan without strength, / Yet they prepare their food in the summer;
The rock badgers are a clan without might, / Yet they make their houses in the rocks;
The swarming locusts have no king, / Yet all of them go out in ranks;
The lizard can be grasped with the hands, / Yet she is in kings' palaces.
There are three things which are stately in their step, / Indeed four which are stately in walking:
The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, / And does not turn back before any;
The strutting cock girded in the loins, or a male goat, / And a king who has a band of soldiers with him.
If you have been foolish in exalting yourself, / Or if you have thought an evil scheme, / Put your hand upon your mouth.
For the churning of milk produces butter, / And the wringing of the nose brings forth blood, / So the pressing of wrath brings forth strife.
