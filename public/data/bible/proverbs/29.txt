He who hardens his neck after being often reproved / Will suddenly be broken beyond remedy.
When the righteous increase, the people rejoice; / But when a wicked man rules, the people groan.
Whoever loves wisdom makes his father glad, / But he who keeps company with harlots wastes his substance.
The king by justice establishes the land, / But a man who takes bribes overthrows it.
A man who flatters his neighbor / Spreads a net for his steps.
In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare, / But the righteous man sings and rejoices.
The righteous man knows the rights of the poor; / The wicked man has no understanding of such knowledge.
Scorners set a city aflame, / But wise men turn away wrath.
If a wise man has a controversy with a foolish man, / The fool is either angry or laughs, and there is no rest.
The bloodthirsty hate one who is perfect, / And they seek the life of the upright.
A fool utters all his anger, / But a wise man holds it back.
If a ruler pays attention to a false word, / All his servants are wicked.
The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: / Jehovah gives light to the eyes of them both.
If a king judges the poor in truth, / His throne will be established forever.
The rod and reproof give wisdom, / But a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.
When the wicked increase, transgression increases; / But the righteous will see their fall.
Correct your son, and he will give you rest; / He will also give delight to your soul.
Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint; / But happy is he who keeps the law.
A servant will not be corrected by words alone; / For though he understands, there will be no response.
Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? / There is more hope for a fool than for him.
He who delicately brings up his servant from a child / Will have him as a son in the end.
An angry man stirs up contention, / And a furious man abounds in transgression.
A man's pride will bring him low, / But he who is of a lowly spirit will obtain honor.
Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own soul; / He hears the adjuration and utters nothing.
The fear of man brings a snare, / But whoever puts his trust in Jehovah will be exalted.
Many seek the ruler's favor, / But justice for man comes from Jehovah.
An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous, / And he who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked man.
