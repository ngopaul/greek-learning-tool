My son, be attentive to my wisdom; / Incline your ear to my understanding,
That you may keep discretion, / And your lips may guard knowledge.
For the lips of a strange woman drip honey, / And her mouth is smoother than oil;
But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, / Sharp as a two-edged sword.
Her feet go down to death; / Her steps hold fast to Sheol.
She does not make straight the path of life: / Her ways wander, and she does not know it.
And now, my sons, listen to me, / And do not depart from the words of my mouth.
Keep your way far from her, / And do not go near the door of her house;
Lest you give your honor to others, / And your years to the cruel;
Lest strangers be filled with your wealth, / And your labors go to the house of a foreigner,
And you mourn at your end, / When your flesh and your body are consumed,
And you say, How I have hated instruction, / And my heart has despised reproof!
And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers / Nor inclined my ear to my instructors;
I was almost into every evil / In the midst of the congregation and assembly.
Drink waters out of your own cistern, / And running water out of your own well.
Should your springs be shed forth, / Like streams of water in the streets?
Let them be yours alone, / And not for strangers with you.
Let your fountain be blessed, / And rejoice in the wife of your youth,
A lovely hind and a graceful doe. / Let her breasts satisfy you at all times. / May you be ravished with her love always.
For why should you be ravished, my son, with a strange woman / And embrace the bosom of an adulteress?
For the ways of a man are before the eyes of Jehovah, / And He ponders all his paths.
The wicked man is taken by his own iniquities, / And he is held fast by the cords of his own sin.
He will die for lack of instruction, / And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.
