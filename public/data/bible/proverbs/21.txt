The king's heart is like streams of water in the hand of Jehovah; / He turns it wherever He wishes.
Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, / But Jehovah weighs the hearts.
To do righteousness and justice / Is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice.
A high look and a proud heart--/ The lamp of the wicked--is sin.
The plans of the diligent lead only to plentifulness, / But everyone who is hasty comes only to want.
The getting of treasures by a lying tongue / Is a fleeting vapor, a snare of death.
The violence of the wicked will sweep them away / Because they refuse to do justice.
The way of a guilty man is crooked; / But as for the pure, his work is right.
It is better to dwell in a corner of a housetop / Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.
The soul of the wicked man desires evil; / His neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.
When the scorner is punished, the simple man becomes wise; / And when the wise man is instructed, he receives knowledge.
The righteous One considers the house of the wicked man, / Overthrowing the wicked to their ruin.
Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor man / Also will cry and will not be heard.
A gift in secret pacifies anger; / And a present in the bosom, strong wrath.
It is joy to the righteous man to do justice, / But it is destruction to the workers of iniquity.
The man who wanders from the way of understanding / Will rest in the assembly of the dead.
He who loves pleasure will be a poor man; / He who loves wine and oil will not be rich.
The wicked man is a ransom for the righteous man, / And the treacherous man is in the place of the upright.
It is better to dwell in a desert land / Than with a contentious and vexing woman.
There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise man, / But a foolish man swallows it up.
He who pursues righteousness and kindness / Finds life, righteousness, and honor.
A wise man scales the city of the mighty / And brings down the strength in which they trust.
Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue / Keeps his soul from troubles.
Proud, Haughty, Scorner are the names / Of him who works in the arrogance of pride.
The desire of the sluggard puts him to death, / For his hands refuse to work.
All day long one covets greedily, / But the righteous man gives and does not hold back.
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; / How much more when he brings it with evil intent!
A false witness will perish, / But the man who hears will speak so as to endure.
A wicked man hardens his face; / But as for the upright, he establishes his ways.
There is no wisdom nor understanding / Nor counsel that can avail against Jehovah.
The horse is prepared for the day of battle, / But victory belongs to Jehovah.
