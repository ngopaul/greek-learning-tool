Do not be envious of evil men, / Nor desire to be with them;
For their heart meditates violence, / And their lips talk of mischief.
Through wisdom a house is built, / And by understanding it is established,
And by knowledge the rooms are filled / With all precious and pleasant riches.
A wise man is strong, / And a man of knowledge increases power.
For by sound counsel you can wage your war, / And in the multitude of counselors there is victory.
Wisdom is too high for a fool; / He does not open his mouth in the gate.
He who devises to do evil, / Men will call him a mischief-maker.
The devising of folly is sin, / And the scorner is an abomination to men.
If you faint in the day of adversity, / Your strength is limited.
Deliver those who are being taken away to death, / And those who are staggering to be slain, oh, hold back!
If you say, Look, we did not know this--/ Does not He who weighs the hearts consider it? / And He who keeps your soul, does He not know it? / And will He not render to every man according to his work?
My son, eat honey, for it is good, / And the drippings from the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:
Know that wisdom is such for your soul; / If you find it, then there will be a latter end, / And your hope will not be cut off.
Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous man; / Do not destroy his resting place;
For a righteous man falls seven times and rises up again, / But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, / And do not let your heart exult when he is overthrown;
Lest Jehovah see it, and it displease Him, / And He turn away His anger from him.
Do not be incensed because of evildoers; / Do not be envious of the wicked;
For there will be no future for the evil man; / The lamp of the wicked will be put out.
My son, fear Jehovah and the king, / And do not associate with those who are given to change;
For their calamity will rise suddenly, / And who knows the misfortune of both of them?
These also are sayings of the wise: / It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.
He who says to the wicked man, You are righteous, / Peoples will curse him; nations will abhor him.
But those who rebuke the wicked man will have delight, / And a good blessing will come upon them.
He who gives an honest answer / Kisses the lips.
Prepare your work outside, / And make it ready for yourself in the field, / And afterward build your house.
Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, / And do not deceive with your lips.
Do not say, I will do to him as he has done to me; / I will render to the man according to his work.
I passed by the field of the sluggard, / And by the vineyard of the man lacking sense;
And there it was, all overgrown with thorns; / Its surface was covered with nettles, / And its stone wall was broken down.
When I looked, I considered it; / I saw it and received instruction:
A little sleep, a little slumber, / A little folding of the hands to rest,
And your poverty will come upon you like a robber, / And your want, like an armed man.
