He who separates himself seeks his own desire / And rages against all sound wisdom.
A fool has no delight in understanding, / But only that his heart may reveal itself.
When the wicked man comes, contempt also comes; / And with dishonor comes reproach.
The words of a man's mouth are deep waters, / A gushing stream, a fountain of wisdom.
To respect the person of the wicked man is not good, / Nor to turn aside the righteous man in judgment.
A fool's lips bring strife, / And his mouth invites blows.
A fool's mouth is his ruin, / And his lips are the snare of his soul.
The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels, / And they go down into the innermost parts of one's being.
He also who is slack in his work / Is brother to him who is a destroyer.
The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; / The righteous man runs into it and is safe.
The rich man's substance is his strong city / And like a high wall in his own imagination.
Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, / But humility goes before honor.
As for him who gives an answer before he hears, / It is folly and shame.
The spirit of a man can sustain his sickness, / But a broken spirit who can bear?
The heart of one who has understanding acquires knowledge, / And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
A man's gift makes room for him / And brings him before great men.
The first to plead his case seems just, / Until his neighbor comes and cross-examines him.
The lot causes contentions to cease / And decides between the mighty.
A brother offended is harder to be gained than a strong city, / And contentions are like the bars of a castle.
With the fruit of his mouth a man's stomach will be satisfied; / With the produce of his lips he will be satisfied.
Death and life are in the power of the tongue, / And those who love it will eat its fruit.
Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, / And obtains favor from Jehovah.
The poor man utters supplications, / But the rich man answers roughly.
A man of many friends comes to destruction, / But there is a true friend that sticks closer than a brother.
