Now these are the kings of the land whom the children of Israel struck and whose land they possessed across the Jordan toward the rising of the sun from the river Arnon to Mount Hermon and all the eastern Arabah:
Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the river Arnon, and from the city in the middle of the river valley, that is, half of Gilead even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
And the eastern Arabah unto the Sea of Chinneroth, even unto the eastern side of the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, toward Beth-jeshimoth, that is, southward to the foot of the slopes of Pisgah;
And the territory of Og the king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt in Ashtaroth and Edrei,
And ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, that is, half of Gilead, to the border of Sihon the king of Heshbon.
Moses the servant of Jehovah and the children of Israel struck them. And Moses the servant of Jehovah gave this land as a possession to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel struck across the Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon unto Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir; and Joshua gave this land to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions,
The land that is in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Arabah and on the slopes and in the wilderness and in the Negev--the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites; the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
