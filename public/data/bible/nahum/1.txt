The burden concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
Jehovah is a jealous God and One who avenges; / Jehovah avenges and is full of wrath; / Jehovah takes vengeance on His adversaries, / And reserves wrath for His enemies.
Jehovah is long-suffering and great in power / And will by no means clear the guilty. / Jehovah--His way is in the whirlwind and in the storm, / And the clouds are the dust of His feet.
He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, / And He dries up all the rivers. / Bashan and Carmel languish, / And the sprout of Lebanon languishes.
The mountains quake because of Him, / And the hills melt, / And the earth is heaved up at His presence, / Indeed the world, and all that inhabit it.
Who can stand before His indignation, / And who can maintain himself in the fierceness of His anger? / His wrath is poured out like fire, / And the rocks are broken down by Him.
Jehovah is good, / A stronghold in a day of distress; / And He knows those who take refuge in Him.
But with an overflowing flood / He will make a full end of her place, / And He will pursue His enemies into darkness.
What do you devise against Jehovah? / He will make a full end; / Distress will not arise a second time.
For though they are entangled like thorns / And like those drunken with their drink, / They will be consumed as fully as dry stubble.
One went forth from you / Who devises evil against Jehovah, / Who counsels wickedness.
Thus says Jehovah, / Though they are complete in number and even numerous, / Even so they will be cut down; and they will pass away. / And though I have afflicted you, / I will afflict you no more.
And now I will break his yoke from off you / And will snap your bonds asunder.
And Jehovah has commanded concerning you: / No more of your name will be sown; / Out of the house of your gods I will cut off / The graven idol and the molten idol; / I will make your grave, for you are worthless.
See, upon the mountains / The feet of him who bears the glad news, / Who announces peace! / Keep your feasts, O Judah; / Complete your vows; / For the wicked one will never again / Pass through you; / He will be completely cut off.
