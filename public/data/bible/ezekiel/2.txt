Then He said to me, Son of man, stand up on your feet, and I will speak with you.
And the Spirit entered into me when He spoke to me and caused me to stand up on my feet. And I heard Him who spoke to me.
And He said to me, Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to rebellious heathen who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me unto this very day;
And they are impudent and hard-hearted children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah.
And they, whether they hear or not--for they are a rebellious house--they will know that a prophet has been in their midst.
And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them and do not be afraid of their words; though thistles and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions, do not be afraid of their words and do not be dismayed at their faces; for they are a rebellious house.
And you shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or not; for they are rebellious.
But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I give you.
And I looked, and there was a hand, put forth toward me; and in it there was a scroll book.
And He spread it before me. And it was written on the front and back, and on it were written lamentations, mourning, and woe.
