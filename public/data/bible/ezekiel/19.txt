But you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
And say, What was your mother? / A lioness among lions. / She lay in the midst of young lions; / She brought up her whelps.
When she raised up one of her whelps, / He became a young lion; / And he learned to take prey; / He devoured men.
Then the nations heard of him; / He was captured in their pit, / And they brought him with hooks / To the land of Egypt.
When she saw that she had waited, / That her hope was lost, / She took another one of her whelps; / She made him a young lion.
And he went about among the lions; / He became a young lion. / And he learned to take prey; / He devoured men.
And he destroyed their citadels / And laid waste their cities; / And the land and its fullness were horrified / At the sound of his roaring.
Then the nations set against him / All around from the provinces / And spread their net over him; / He was captured in their pit.
And they put him in a cage with hooks / And brought him to the king of Babylon--/ They brought him into strongholds--/ That his voice would no longer be heard / Upon the mountains of Israel.
Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, / Transplanted beside the waters; / It was fruitful and full of branches / Because of abundant waters.
And it had strong branches / For scepters of those who rule; / And its height was exalted among the leafy boughs, / And it was visible in its height because of the multitude of its branches.
But it was plucked up in wrath; / It was cast down to the ground; / And the east wind dried up its fruit; / Its strong branch was broken off and it withered; / The fire consumed it.
And now it is transplanted in the wilderness, / In a dry and thirsty land.
And fire has gone forth from its branch; / It has consumed its offshoots and its fruit, / So that there is no strong branch in it, / A scepter to rule. This is a lamentation and it has become a lamentation.
