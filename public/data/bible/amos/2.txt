Thus says Jehovah, Because of three transgressions of Moab, / Indeed, because of four, I will not turn away the punishment; / Because he burned the bones / Of the king of Edom into lime.
And I will send fire upon Moab, / And it will devour the palaces of Kerioth; / And Moab will die amid tumult, / With shouting, with the sound of a trumpet.
And I will cut off the judge from the midst of it / And will slay all its princes with him, / Says Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah, Because of three transgressions of Judah, / Indeed, because of four, I will not turn away the punishment; / Because they have rejected the law of Jehovah / And have not kept His statutes; / And their lies have caused them to err, / The lies which their fathers walked after.
And I will send fire upon Judah, / And it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
Thus says Jehovah, Because of three transgressions of Israel, / Indeed, because of four, I will not turn away the punishment; / Because they have sold the righteous for silver / And the needy for a pair of sandals--
They who pant after the dust of the earth upon the heads of the poor, / And turn aside the way of the meek. / And a man and his father go in unto the same young woman, / In order to profane My holy name.
And upon garments taken as pledge they lay themselves down / Beside every altar, / And in the house of their God they drink / The wine of those who have been fined.
But I destroyed the Amorite before them, / Whose height was like the height of the cedars, / And he was as strong as the oaks; / Yet I destroyed his fruit from above / And his roots from beneath.
And I brought you up from the land of Egypt / And led you in the wilderness for forty years, / To possess the land of the Amorites.
And I raised up some of your sons as prophets / And some of your young men as Nazarites. / Is it not indeed so, O children of Israel? / Declares Jehovah.
But you made the Nazarites drink wine / And commanded the prophets, saying, Do not prophesy.
Indeed I will press on you, / As a cart that is full of sheaves presses.
And flight will perish from the swift, / And the strong will not strengthen his force, / Nor will the mighty deliver his soul;
And he who wields the bow will not stand, / And he who is swift of foot will not deliver himself, / And he who rides the horse will not deliver his soul.
And he who is stout-hearted among the mighty men / Will flee away naked in that day, / Declares Jehovah.
