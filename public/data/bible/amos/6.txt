Woe to those who are at ease in Zion / And to those who are secure in the mountain of Samaria, / The distinguished among the chief of the nations, / To whom the house of Israel comes!
Go over into Calneh, and see; / And go from there to Hamath the great; / Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. / Are they better than these kingdoms? / Or is their territory greater than your territory?
You who thrust away the evil day / And cause the seat of violence to draw near,
You who lie upon beds of ivory / And sprawl out upon your couches / And eat the lambs from the flock / And the calves from the midst of the stall,
You who prattle to the tune of the harp, / Who make for yourselves instruments of song like David,
You who drink wine in sacrificial bowls / And anoint yourselves with the finest oils; / Yet you are not grieved about the destruction of Joseph.
Therefore they will now go into captivity with the first of the captives, / And the cry of revelry from those who sprawled themselves out will pass away.
The Lord Jehovah has sworn by Himself, / Declares Jehovah the God of hosts, / I abhor the pride of Jacob, / And his palaces I hate; / Therefore I will deliver up the city and its fullness.
And if ten men remain in one house, they will die.
When his kinsman, that is, he who should burn his body, takes him up to bring his bones from the house, and says to him who is in the innermost part of the house, Are there any more with you, and that one says, None; then he will say, Hush, for the name of Jehovah should not be mentioned.
For it is Jehovah who commands, / And He will strike the great house into fragments / And the little house into pieces.
Do horses run on rock? / Or does one plow there with oxen? / But you have turned justice into poison, / And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,
You who rejoice in that which is nothing, / You who say, Have we not taken / By our own strength horns for ourselves?
For I am about to raise up a nation over you, / O house of Israel, declares Jehovah the God of hosts, / And they will oppress you / From the entrance of Hamath / To the brook of the Arabah.
