Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me, and there was a basket of summer fruit.
And He said, What do you see, Amos? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then Jehovah said to me, / The end has come upon My people Israel; / I will not pass them by anymore.
And the songs of the temple will be wailings / In that day, declares the Lord Jehovah. / The corpses will be many; / In every place / They will cast them. Hush!
Hear this, you who pant after the needy / To destroy the wretched of the earth,
Saying, When will the new moon be over, that we may sell grain? / And the Sabbath, that we may lay open the wheat? / In order to make the ephah small and the shekel large / And to falsify the balances for deceit;
That we may buy the poor for silver / And the needy for a pair of sandals, / And sell the refuse of the wheat.
Jehovah has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, / I shall by no means forget any of their deeds forever.
Will the land not quake because of this, / And will all who dwell in it not mourn? / Indeed all of it will rise up like the River, / And it will be driven and will sink like the river of Egypt.
And in that day, / Declares the Lord Jehovah, / I will cause the sun to go down at noon, / And I will darken the land in the light of day.
And I will turn your feasts into mourning / And all your songs into lamentation; / And I will bring up sackcloth upon all the loins / And baldness upon every head; / And I will make it like the mourning for an only child / And the end of it like a bitter day.
Indeed days are coming, / Declares the Lord Jehovah, / When I will send a hunger into the land, / Not a hunger for bread / Nor a thirst for water, / But for hearing the words of Jehovah.
And they will totter from sea to sea, / And from the north even to the east; / They will rove about, seeking the word of Jehovah, / But they will not find it.
In that day the beautiful virgins and the young men / Will swoon because of thirst.
They who swear by the trespass of Samaria / And say, As your god lives, O Dan! / And, As the way of Beer-sheba lives! / Indeed they will fall and not rise up again.
