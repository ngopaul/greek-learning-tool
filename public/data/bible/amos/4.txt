Hear this word, / O heifers of Bashan, which are on the mountain of Samaria, / Who oppress the poor / And crush the needy, / Who say to their lords, / Bring, and let us drink.
The Lord Jehovah has sworn by His holiness, / Indeed days are coming upon you / When one will take you away with hooks, / And your posterity, with fish hooks.
And you will go out through the breaches, each one straight ahead of her; / And you will cast yourselves into Harmon, declares Jehovah.
Come to Bethel, and transgress; / To Gilgal, and multiply transgression; / And bring your sacrifices every morning / And your tithes every three days,
And offer in smoke a thank offering out of what is leavened; / And proclaim freewill offerings; make them known; / For you love them, O children of Israel, / Declares the Lord Jehovah.
And I also have given you / Cleanness of teeth in all your cities / And want of bread in all your places. / Yet you have not returned to Me, / Declares Jehovah.
And I have also withheld the rain from you / When there was yet three months until the harvest; / And I made it rain on one city, / But on another city I did not make it rain; / One portion was rained on, / And the portion that was not rained on dried up.
And two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water, / But they were not satisfied. / Yet you have not returned to Me, / Declares Jehovah.
I have stricken you with blight and mildew; / The multitudes of your gardens and your vineyards, / And your fig trees and your olive trees, the cutting locust has devoured. / Yet you have not returned to Me, / Declares Jehovah.
I have sent among you pestilence after the manner of Egypt; / I have slain your choice young men with the sword, taking your horses captive; / And I have caused the stench of your camp to go up even into your own nostrils. / Yet you have not returned to Me, / Declares Jehovah.
I have overturned cities among you, / As when God overturned Sodom and Gomorrah; / And you were like a brand plucked out of the burning. / Yet you have not returned to Me, / Declares Jehovah.
Therefore this is what I will do to you, O Israel; / And because I will do this to you, / Prepare to meet your God, O Israel.
For it is He who forms the mountains and creates the wind / And declares to man what His thought is; / He who makes the morning darkness / And treads upon the high places of the earth--/ Jehovah the God of hosts is His name!
