Hear this word that I take up as a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.
Fallen and no more to rise / Is the virgin of Israel; / She has been cast down upon her land; / There is none to raise her up.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah, The city that sent forth a thousand / Will have a hundred left, / And that which sent forth a hundred / Will have ten left, / To the house of Israel.
For thus says Jehovah to the house of Israel, Seek Me, and live;
And do not seek Bethel, / Nor go to Gilgal, / Nor pass on to Beer-sheba; / For Gilgal will surely go into captivity, / And Bethel will become vanity.
Seek Jehovah, and live; / Lest He rush upon the house of Joseph like fire, / And it devour it, and there be none to extinguish the fire in Bethel.
They turn justice to wormwood / And thrust righteousness down to the ground.
He who makes the Pleiades and Orion / And turns the shadow of death into the morning / And darkens the day with the night; / He who calls for the water of the sea / And pours it upon the surface of the earth, / Jehovah is His name,
Who causes destruction to flash forth upon the strong, / So that destruction comes upon the fortress.
They hate him who reproves in the gate, / And him who speaks with integrity they abhor.
Therefore because you trample upon the poor / And take a forced gift of wheat from them; / You have built houses of hewn stone, / But you will not dwell in them; / You have planted desirable vineyards, / But you will not drink their wine.
For I know that your transgressions are many / And that your sins are mighty, / You who vex the righteous and take ransom payment / And turn aside justice for the needy in the gate.
Therefore he who has insight will keep silent at this time, for it is an evil time.
Seek good and not evil, / In order that you may live; / And so Jehovah the God of hosts will be with you, / As you say.
Hate evil and love good, / And set up justice in the gate. / Perhaps Jehovah the God of hosts will be gracious / To the remnant of Joseph.
Therefore thus says Jehovah, / The God of hosts, the Lord: / In all the open plazas there will be wailing, / And in all the streets they will say, Alas! Alas! / And they will call the farmer to mourning, / And for wailing to those skilled in lamentation.
In all the vineyards there will be wailing, / For I will pass through your midst, says Jehovah.
Woe to you who desire / The day of Jehovah! / What good is the day of Jehovah to you? / It will be darkness and not light,
As when a man flees from before a lion / And encounters a bear, / Or goes into the house and leans his hand against the wall, / And a serpent bites him.
Will not the day of Jehovah be darkness and not light, / Even deep darkness and no brightness to it?
I hate, I despise, your feasts, / And I will not delight in your solemn assemblies.
For if you offer up to Me burnt offerings / And your meal offerings, I will not accept them; / Nor will I regard the peace offerings of your fatted animals.
Take the noise of your songs away from Me, / For I will not hear the melody of your harps.
But let justice roll down like water, / And righteousness, like an ever-flowing river.
Did you bring Me sacrifices and meal offerings / In the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel?
Indeed, you took up Sikkuth your king / And Kiyyun your images, the star of your gods that you made for yourselves.
Thus I will bring you into captivity / Beyond Damascus, says Jehovah; / The God of hosts is His name.
