I saw the Lord standing upon the altar. And He said, Strike the capitals of the pillars / That the thresholds may shake. / And break them off upon the heads of them all, / And the last of them I will slay with the sword: / Any one of them who flees will not flee away, / And any one of them who escapes will not slip by.
Though they dig into Sheol, / From there My hand will take them; / And though they go up into heaven, / From there I will bring them down.
And though they hide at the top of Carmel, / From there I will seek them and take them. / And though they hide themselves from My sight on the floor of the sea, / There I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.
And though they go into captivity before their enemies, / There I will command the sword, and it will slay them; / And I will set My eyes upon them / For evil and not for good.
For the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Is the One who touches the land and it melts, / And all those who dwell in it mourn; / And all of it rises like the River, / And it sinks like the river of Egypt.
He is the One who builds His upper stories in the heavens / And has founded His vault over the earth; / He is the One who calls for the water of the sea / And pours it upon the surface of the earth; / Jehovah is His name.
Are you not like the children of the Cushites / To Me, O children of Israel? / Declares Jehovah. / Have I not brought up Israel / Out from the land of Egypt, / And the Philistines out from Caphtor, / And Aram out from Kir?
Yes, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah / Are on the sinful kingdom, / And I will destroy it / From off the face of the earth, / Except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, / Declares Jehovah.
For I will command / And shake the house of Israel among all the nations, / As grain is shaken in the sieve; / Yet a kernel will not fall to the ground.
All the sinners of My people / Will die by the sword, / Those who say, Evil will not overtake us / Nor come before us on all sides.
In that day I will raise up / The fallen tabernacle of David, / And I will wall up its breaches / And raise up its ruins / And build it up as it was in the days of old;
That they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations which are called by My name, declares Jehovah who does this.
Indeed days are coming, / Declares Jehovah, / When the plowman will overtake the reaper, / And the grape treader, him who sows the seed; / And the mountains will drip sweet wine, / And all the hills will melt.
And I will turn the captivity of My people Israel, / And they will build the desolated cities and inhabit them; / And they will plant vineyards and drink the wine from them, / And make gardens and eat the fruit from them.
And I will plant them upon their land, and they will not be plucked up again from their land, which I have given to them, says Jehovah your God.
