And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, as well as cedar timbers and masons and carpenters to build a house for him.
And David perceived that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of His people Israel.
And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters.
And these are the names of those who were born, whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon
And Ibhar and Elishua and Elpelet
And Nogah and Nepheg and Japhia
And Elishama and Beeliada and Eliphelet.
Now when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard of it and went out against them.
And the Philistines came and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
Then David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up, and I will deliver them into your hand.
And they went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there. And David said, God has broken forth upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of a flood. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
And they left their gods there; and David gave the order, and they were burned with fire.
And the Philistines made yet another raid in the valley.
And David inquired again of God, and God said to him, You shall not go up after them; go around behind them, and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.
And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle; for God will have gone forth before you to strike the army of the Philistines.
And David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even unto Gezer.
And David's fame went forth among all the lands, and Jehovah put the fear of him upon all the nations.
