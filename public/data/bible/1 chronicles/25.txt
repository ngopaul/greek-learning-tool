Moreover David and the leaders of the army set apart for the service some of the sons of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun to prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals. And the list of those who did the work according to their service was:
Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur and Joseph and Nethaniah and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied under the king's direction.
Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah and Zeri and Jeshaiah and Shimei and Hashabiah and Mattithiah, six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun with the lyre, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Jehovah.

All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer, for exalting His power with the words of God; and God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
All these were under the direction of their father for song in the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, for the service of the house of God, Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the direction of the king.
And the number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Jehovah, all of whom were skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight.
