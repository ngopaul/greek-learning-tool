A trumpet to your lips! / Like an eagle he comes against the house of Jehovah, / Because they have trespassed My covenant / And have transgressed against My law.
They will cry unto Me, / My God, we--Israel--know You.
Israel has cast off what is good; / The enemy will pursue him.
They have set up kings, but not by Me; / They have set up princes, but I did not acknowledge it. / With their silver and their gold they made / Idols for themselves, / That they might be cut off.
Your calf has cast you off, O Samaria; / My anger burns against them. / How long will they be incapable of innocence?
For from Israel is this! / A workman made it; / Thus it is no God. / The calf of Samaria / Will be shattered to pieces.
For they have sown wind, / And they will reap a whirlwind. / It has no stalk; should there be a sprout, / It will not produce flour; / If it should produce, / Strangers will swallow it up.
Israel has been swallowed up; / Now they have become among the nations / Like a vessel in which no one takes pleasure.
For they have gone up to Assyria / Like a wild ass gone alone by itself; / Ephraim has hired lovers.
Indeed though they have hired such among the nations, / I will now gather them; / And they will begin to be diminished because of the burden / Of the king of the princes.
Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, / Altars will be to him for sin.
I wrote for him the ten thousand things of My law, / But they are considered as a strange thing.
As for the sacrifices of My offerings, / They sacrifice flesh and eat it, / But Jehovah has no delight in them. / Now He will remember their iniquity, / And He will punish their sins; / They will return to Egypt.
For Israel has forgotten his Maker / And has built palaces, / And Judah has multiplied fortified cities; / But I will send fire into his cities, / And it will devour its citadels.
