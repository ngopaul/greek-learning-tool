Ephraim feeds on wind / And follows the east wind continually; / He multiplies lies and violence. / They make a covenant with Assyria, / And oil is carried into Egypt.
Jehovah has also a controversy with Judah / And will punish Jacob according to his ways; / According to his doings He will recompense him.
In the womb he grasped his brother by the heel, / And in his full strength he contended with God.
Indeed he contended with the Angel and prevailed; / He wept and made supplication to Him. / At Bethel he found Him; / And there He spoke with us,
Even Jehovah the God of hosts; / Jehovah is His memorial.
And you, return there to your God; / Keep lovingkindness and justice, / And wait on your God continually.
He is a merchant; / In his hand are balances of deceit; / He loves to extort.
And Ephraim said, / I have surely become rich; / I have found wealth for myself. / In all my labors / They will find with me / No iniquity, which would be sin.
But I have been Jehovah your God / Since the land of Egypt; / Yet again I will cause you to dwell in tents / As in the days of the appointed feast.
I have also spoken unto the prophets: / And I have multiplied vision, / And through the prophets I have used similitudes.
Is Gilead iniquity? They are altogether vanity. / In Gilgal they sacrifice oxen; / Indeed their altars are like heaps / In the furrows of a field.
And Jacob fled into the country of Aram; / And Israel served for a wife, / And for a wife he kept sheep.
And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up from Egypt, / And by a prophet he was kept.
Ephraim provoked Him to bitter anger; / Therefore his Lord will leave his bloodshed upon him / And will recompense him with his own reproach.
