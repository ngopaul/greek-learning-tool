When Israel was a child, I loved him, / And out of Egypt I called My son.
As they called them, / So they went from them; / To the Baals they sacrificed, / And to the idols they burned incense.
And it was I who taught Ephraim to walk / (He took them in His arms), / But they did not know that I healed them.
I drew them with cords of a man, / With bands of love; / And I was to them like those / Who lift off the yoke on their jaws; / And I gently caused them to eat.
They will not return to the land of Egypt, / But the Assyrian will be their king, / For they refused to return to Me.
And the sword will whirl about in their cities / And will consume their bars, / And it will devour them because of their own counsels.
Indeed My people are bent upon turning away from Me; / Though they call them to Him who is on high, / None at all exalts Him.
How shall I give you up, O Ephraim? / How shall I deliver you up, O Israel? / How can I make you like Admah? / How can I treat you like Zeboim? / My heart is turned within Me; / All My compassions have warmed.
I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; / I will not return to destroy Ephraim; / For I am God and not man, / The Holy One in the midst of you, / And I will not come in wrath.
They will walk after Jehovah; / He will roar like a lion. / For He will roar, / And the children will come trembling from the west.
They will come trembling like a bird from Egypt / And like a dove from the land of Assyria. / And I will cause them to dwell in their houses, / Declares Jehovah.
Ephraim encompasses Me with lies, / And the house of Israel, with deceit; / And Judah is yet unsteadfast with God / And with the Holy One, the Faithful One.
