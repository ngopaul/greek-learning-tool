Say to your brothers, Ammi, / And to your sisters, Ruhamah.
Contend with your mother; contend. / For she is not My wife, / And I am not her Husband. / And let her turn away her harlotries from her face, / And her adulteries from between her breasts,
Lest I strip her naked / And set her out as in the day she was born / And make her a wilderness / And make her a dry land / And slay her with thirst.
And on her children I will not have compassion, / For they are the children of harlotries.
For their mother has gone about as a harlot; / She who conceived them has acted shamefully; / For she has said, / I will go after my lovers, / Who give me my bread and my water, / My wool and my flax, / My oil and my drink.
Therefore I will now hedge up / Her way with thorns; / And I will build up a wall against her, / So that she will not find her paths.
And she will pursue her lovers / But will not overtake them; / And she will seek them but not find them; / And she will say, I will go / And return to my first Husband, / For it was better for me then than now.
For she did not know / That it was I who gave her / The grain and the new wine and the fresh oil, / And who multiplied to her silver / And gold, which they used for Baal.
Therefore I will take back / My grain in its time / And My new wine in its appointed season, / And I will snatch away My wool and My flax, / Which were to cover her nakedness.
And now I will uncover her lewdness / In the sight of her lovers, / And no one will deliver her from My hand.
And I will bring all her mirth to an end, / Her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, / And all her appointed assemblies.
And I will desolate her vine and her fig tree, / Of which she said, / These are my payments / That my lovers have given me; / And I will make them a forest, / And the beasts of the field will devour them.
And I will visit the days of the Baals upon her, / In which she burned incense to them / And adorned herself with her nose rings and her jewels / And went after her lovers / And forgot Me, / Declares Jehovah.
Therefore I am now luring her, / And I will bring her into the wilderness / And will speak to her heart.
And I will give her her vineyards from there / And the valley of Achor as a door of hope; / And she will respond there as in the days of her youth / And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
And in that day, declares Jehovah, / You will call Me My Husband / And will no longer call Me Baali.
For I will take away the names of the Baals from her mouth, / And they will no longer be remembered by their name.
And I will make a covenant for them / In that day / With the beasts of the field / And with the birds of heaven / And the creeping things of the earth; / And bow and sword and battle / I will break from the land, / And I will cause them to lie down in safety.
And I will betroth you to Myself forever; / Indeed I will betroth you to Myself / In righteousness and justice / And in lovingkindness and compassions;
Indeed I will betroth you to Myself in faithfulness, / And you will know Jehovah.
And in that day / I will answer, declares Jehovah; / I will answer the heavens, / And they will answer the earth,
And the earth will answer the grain / And the new wine and the fresh oil, / And they will answer Jezreel.
And I will sow her for Myself in the land; / And I will have compassion on Lo-ruhamah, / And I will say to Lo-ammi, You are My people; / And they will say, My God.
