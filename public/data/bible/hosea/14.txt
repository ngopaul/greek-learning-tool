Return, O Israel, / To Jehovah your God, / For you have fallen by your iniquity.
Take words with you, / And return to Jehovah; / Say to Him, / Forgive all iniquity, / And take us graciously; / Thus we will render our lips as bulls.
Assyria will not save us; / We will not ride upon horses. / Neither will we say again to the work of our hands, Our God! / Because in You the orphan finds compassion.
I will heal their apostasy; / I will love them freely; / For My anger has turned away from him.
I will be like the dew to Israel; / He will bud like the lily / And will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon.
His shoots will go forth; / And his splendor will be like that of the olive tree, / And his fragrance, like that of the trees of Lebanon.
Those who sit under his shade will return; / They will revive like grain / And will bud like the vine; / His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.
Ephraim says, What have I yet to do with idols? / I respond and look on him. / I am like a green fir tree; / From Me your fruit is found.
Who is wise? / Then let him understand these things. / Who is intelligent? Then let him know them. / For the ways of Jehovah are right, / And the righteous will walk in them, / But the transgressors will stumble in them.
