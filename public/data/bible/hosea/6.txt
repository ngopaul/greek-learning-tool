Come and let us return to Jehovah; / For He has torn us, but He will heal us, / And He has stricken us, but He will bind us up.
He will enliven us after two days; / On the third day He will raise us up, / And we will live in His presence.
Therefore let us know, let us pursue knowing Jehovah: / His going forth is as sure as the dawn, / And He will come to us as the rain, / As the late rain which waters the earth.
What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? / What shall I do with you, O Judah? / For your lovingkindness is like a morning cloud / And like dew that departs early.
Therefore I hewed them to pieces by the prophets; / I slew them by the words of My mouth, / And My judgments went forth as light.
For I delight in lovingkindness and not sacrifice, / And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant; / There they have acted treacherously against Me.
Gilead is a city of those who commit iniquity; / It is tracked with blood.
And like bands of robbers lying in wait for a man, / The company of priests murder on the way to Shechem; / Indeed they commit wickedness.
In the house of Israel I have seen a horrid thing: / The harlotry of Ephraim is there; / Israel has defiled itself.
Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, / When I will turn the captivity of My people.
