When I would heal Israel, / Then the iniquity of Ephraim is discovered / As well as the evil deeds of Samaria; / For they practice falsehood. / And the thief comes inside; / The band of robbers makes raids outside.
And they do not say in their hearts / That I remember all their evil. / Now their doings are all around them; / They are before My face.
They make the king glad with their evil, / And the princes, with their lies.
All of them practice adultery; / They are like an oven heated by the baker: / He ceases from stirring the fire, / After kneading the dough, until it is leavened.
On the feast day of our king / The princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; / He stretched out his hand with scorners.
For they have made their heart ready / Like an oven while they lie in wait: / All night long / Their baker sleeps, / But in the morning the oven burns / Like a flaming fire.
All of them are hot like an oven, / And they devour their judges; / All their kings fall; / There is no one among them who calls on Me.
Ephraim--among the peoples / He mixes himself; / Ephraim is a cake / Not turned.
Strangers have devoured his strength, / And he himself does not know it; / Indeed gray hairs are all over him, / And he himself does not know it.
And the pride of Israel testifies to his face; / Yet they have not returned to Jehovah their God, / And they have not sought Him, because of all this.
And Ephraim has become like a silly dove / Without understanding: / They call to Egypt; / They go to Assyria.
When they go, / I will spread My net over them; / I will bring them down like the birds of heaven; / I will chasten them according to the report given to their assembly.
Woe to them! For they have wandered from Me. / Devastation to them! For they have transgressed against Me. / And I would have redeemed them, / But they have spoken lies against Me.
And they did not cry unto Me in their heart / When they howled in their beds. / For grain and new wine they assemble themselves; / They rebel against Me.
Though I trained them and strengthened their arms, / They devise evil against Me.
They return, but not to Him who is on high; / They are like a deceitful bow. / Their princes will fall by the sword / Because of the rage of their tongue. / This will be their derision / In the land of Egypt.
