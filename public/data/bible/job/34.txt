Then Elihu continued and said,
Hear my words, you wise men; / And you who know, give ear to me.
For the ear tries words / As the palate tastes food.
Let us choose for ourselves what is right; / Let us know among ourselves what is good.
For Job has said, I am righteous, / And God has taken away my right;
Should I lie against my right? / My arrow wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.
What man is like Job, / Who drinks up scoffing like water,
Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity / And walks with wicked men?
For he has said, It does not profit a man / To delight himself in God.
Therefore, you men of understanding, hear me: / Far be it from God that He would do evil, / And from the Almighty that He would commit iniquity.
For He will render a man's work to him / And will cause a man to find that which is according to his own way.
Indeed in all certainty God will not do evil, / And the Almighty will not pervert justice.
Who has ever put the earth in His charge? / Or who has ever set in order the whole world?
If He were to consider Himself only, / He would gather back to Himself His spirit and His breath;
All flesh would perish together, / And man would return to dust.
If then you have understanding, hear this; / Give ear to the voice of my words.
Shall one who hates justice govern? / And will you condemn the just and mighty One,
He who says to a king, You worthless one! / And to nobles, You wicked one!
He who does not respect the persons of princes, / Nor regard the rich man more than the poor, / For they are all the work of His hands?
In a moment they die, and in the middle of the night / The people are shaken, and they pass away; / And the mighty are taken away, but by no human hand.
For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, / And He sees all his steps.
There is no darkness and no shadow of death / Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
For He does not need to consider a man further, / That he should go to God in litigation.
He breaks mighty men in pieces without inquiry / And puts others in their stead.
Hence He knows their actions, / And He overturns them in the night so that they are crushed.
He strikes them as He would evil men, / In a place where all can see;
Because they turned aside from following after Him / And would not regard any of His ways,
So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, / And He heard the cry of the afflicted.
When He is silent, who can condemn Him? / When He hides His face, who can behold Him? / He does so toward a nation and toward a man alike,
That no profane man would reign, that there would be no snares for the people.
For has anyone ever said to God, / I have borne chastisement; I will offend no more;
What I do not see teach me; / If I have committed iniquity, I will do it no more?
Should He recompense to fit you, since you have rejected it? / For you must choose, and not I. / So speak what you know.
Men of understanding will say to me, / As well as the man of wisdom who hears me,
Job has spoken without knowledge, / And his words are without insight.
I wish that Job were tried to the limit / Because of his answering like evil men.
For he adds rebellion to his sin; / Among us he claps his hands / And multiplies his words against God.
