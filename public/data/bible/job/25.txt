Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
Dominion and dread are with Him; / He makes peace in His high places.
Is there any number to His armies? / And upon whom does His light not arise?
How then can a man be righteous with God? / And how can one born of a woman be pure?
Indeed, even the moon has no brightness, / And the stars are not pure in His eyes.
How much less a man, a maggot; / And the son of man, a worm!
