Then Job answered and said,
Surely then you are the people, / And wisdom will die with you.
I also have understanding as you do; / I am not inferior to you. / And who does not know things like these?
I have become a laughingstock to my friends, / I, who have called out to God and He answers me. / The righteous man, the perfect man, is a laughingstock.
There is contempt for calamity in the thought of him who is at ease: / It is prepared for those whose foot slips.
The tents of robbers prosper, / And those who provoke God have security, / Those who carry their god in their own might.
But ask now of the beasts, and they will teach you; / And of the birds of heaven, and they will tell you.
Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; / And the fish of the sea will declare to you.
Who among all these does not know / That the hand of Jehovah has done this,
In whose hand is the life of every living thing / And the breath of all flesh of man?
Does not the ear try words / Even as the palate tastes food for itself?
In aged men, you say, there is wisdom, / And in length of days there is understanding.
But with Him are wisdom and might; / Counsel and understanding are His.
Indeed, He breaks down, and it cannot be rebuilt; / He shuts a man up, and the door cannot be opened.
Indeed, He withholds the waters, and they dry up; / And He sends them forth, and they overturn the earth.
With Him are strength and effectual wisdom; / The deceived and the deceiver are His.
He leads counselors away stripped, / And He makes fools of judges.
He loosens the fetters of kings / And binds their loins with a belt.
He leads priests away stripped, / And He overturns dignitaries.
He removes the utterance of the trusty / And takes away the counsel of the elders.
He pours contempt upon the princes / And loosens the belt of the strong.
He uncovers the depths out of darkness / And brings to light the shadow of death.
He makes nations great and destroys them; / He expands nations and leads them off.
He removes the understanding of the heads of the people of the earth / And causes them to wander in a pathless waste.
They grope in darkness, and there is no light; / And He causes them to stagger like a drunken man.
