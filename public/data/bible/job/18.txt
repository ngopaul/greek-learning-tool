Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
How long will you hunt for words? / Consider, and afterward we will speak.
Why are we considered to be like beasts / And have become unclean in your eyes?
You who tear yourself in your anger, / Will the earth be forsaken for your sake, / Or will the rock be removed from its place?
Indeed the light of the wicked goes out, / And the flame of his fire does not shine.
The light is darkness in his tent, / And his lamp above him goes out.
The steps of his strength are confined, / And his counsel has cast him down.
For he has been cast into a net by his own feet, / And he walks about on the webbing of a pitfall.
A snare grabs him by the heel; / A trap lays hold on him.
A rope is hidden for him on the ground, / And a trap for him, on the path.
Terrors frighten him all around / And chase him at his heels.
His strength is famished, / And calamity is prepared at his side.
It devours the members of his body; / The firstborn of death devours his members.
He is rooted out of his tent, in which he trusts; / And he is made to march to the king of terrors.
That which is not his dwells in his tent; / Brimstone is scattered upon his habitation.
Beneath, his roots are dried up; / And above, his branch is withered.
The memory of him perishes from the earth, / And he has no name on the open plain.
He is thrust out from the light to the darkness / And driven from the world.
He has no posterity and no progeny among his people, / And there are none remaining where he sojourned.
Those who come after will be astonished at his day, / As those who went before were horrified.
Surely these are the dwellings of the unjust, / And this is the place of him who does not know God.
