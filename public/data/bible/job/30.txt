But now those who are younger than I / Hold me in derision, / Those whose fathers I disdained / To put with the dogs of my flock.
Indeed, what good is the strength of their hands to me? / Their vigor has perished from them.
Withered up through want and hunger, / They gnaw at the dry ground, / A gloom of waste and desolation.
They pick the mallow upon the bushes, / And the roots of the broom shrub are their food.
They are driven from the company of men; / Men cry after them as after a thief;
So that they must dwell in the most dreadful ravines, / In caves of the earth and in the rocks.
Among the bushes they bray; / Under the nettles they huddle.
Sons of fools, indeed sons of nameless men, / They have been stricken from the land.
And now I have become their song, / And I am a byword to them.
They abhor me; they stand aloof from me; / And they do not withhold their spit from my face.
For He has loosened my cord and afflicted me; / Therefore they have cast off restraint in my presence.
At my right hand a brood rises up; / They send my feet running / And cast up against me their ways of destruction.
They break up my path; / They promote my calamity, / Though there is no profit to them.
As through a wide breach they come in; / Amid the ruin they roll on.
Terrors are turned upon me; / My honor is pursued as by a wind, / And my prosperity passes away like a cloud.
And now my soul is poured out within me; / Days of affliction have taken hold of me.
The night rends my bones from me, / And my gnawing pains do not rest.
With great force my garment is distorted; / It binds me like the collar of my coat.
He has cast me into the mire, / And I am like dust and ashes.
I cry unto You, but You do not answer me; / I stand up, and You stare at me.
You have turned to become cruel to me; / With the might of Your hand You pursue me.
You lift me up into the wind; You make me ride on it; / And You dissolve me in the storm.
For I know that You will bring me into death, / And to the house appointed for all living.
Nevertheless does not a man put forth his hand when he falls, / Or because of his disaster therefore cry out?
Did I not weep for him who had hard days? / Was my soul not grieved for the needy?
When I expected good, evil came; / And when I waited for light, darkness came.
My inward parts are in turmoil and are not still; / Days of affliction have drawn near to me.
I go about in sunless mourning. / I rise up in the congregation; I cry for help.
I am a brother to jackals / And a companion to ostriches.
My skin is black and falling from me, / And my bones burn with heat.
My lyre has become mourning, / And my pipe, the voice of those who weep.
