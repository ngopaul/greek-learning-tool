But now, Job, hear my speaking, / And give ear to all my words.
Indeed now, I have opened my mouth; / My tongue has spoken in my mouth.
My words manifest the uprightness of my heart, / And what my lips know they speak sincerely.
The Spirit of God has made me, / And the breath of the Almighty has enlivened me.
If you can, respond to me; / Arrange your words before me; take your stand.
Indeed, I am before God as you are; / I too was cut out of clay.
So no fear of me can terrify you, / Nor can my pressure be heavy upon you.
You have surely spoken in my hearing, / And I have heard the voice of your words, saying,
I am clean and without transgression; / I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me.
See, He finds occasions for hostility against me; / He considers me as His enemy.
He puts my feet in stocks; / He watches all my paths.
However, in this you are not right, I will answer you, / For God is greater than man.
Why do you contend with Him, / Saying that He does not answer for any of His affairs?
For God speaks in one way, / Indeed in two ways, without any perceiving it--
In a dream, a night vision, / When deep sleep falls upon men / In the slumberings upon their beds--
Then He opens the ears of men / And seals up their instruction,
That He may turn man aside from his doing / And hide pride from man.
He keeps his soul from the pit, / And his life from perishing by the sword.
He is also chastened with pain upon his bed / And with continual strife in his bones,
So that his life abhors bread, / And his soul, fancy food.
His flesh is so consumed that it cannot be seen, / And his bones that had not been seen stick out.
And his soul draws near to the pit, / And his life, to the destroyers.
If there is with him an angel, / An interpreter, one of a thousand, / To declare to man what is right for him,
Then He will be gracious to him and will say, / Redeem him from going down into the pit; / I have found a ransom.
His flesh will be fresher than in childhood; / He will return to the days of his youth.
He will pray to God, and He will accept him, / So that he sees His face with joyous shouting; / And God restores to man his righteousness.
He will sing to men and say, / I sinned and perverted what was right, / But it was not paid back to me.
He has redeemed my soul from perishing in the pit, / And my life will see the light.
Indeed, all these things God accomplishes for a man, / Twice, even three times,
To bring his soul back from the pit, / To enlighten him with the light of the living.
Take heed, Job; hear me. / Be silent, and I will speak.
If you have anything to say, answer me; / Speak, for I desire to justify you.
If not, you listen to me; / Be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.
