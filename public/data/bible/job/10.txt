My soul loathes my own life; / I will let my complaint have free course in me; / I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
I will say to God, Do not account me wicked; / Make known to me why You contend with me.
Does it seem good to You to oppress, / To despise the toil of Your hands / And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
Do You have eyes of flesh? / Or do You see as a man sees?
Are Your days like the days of a man, / Or Your years like the days of a mighty man,
That You would seek out my iniquity / And search for my sin,
Even though You know that I am not wicked / And that there is none who can deliver out of Your hand?
Your hands have shaped me and made me altogether, / Yet You destroy me.
Remember now that You have made me like clay; / And will You return me to the dust?
Have You not poured me out like milk / And curdled me like cheese?
You have clothed me with skin and flesh / And woven me together with bones and sinews.
You have granted me life and lovingkindness, / And Your visitation has preserved my spirit.
But You have hidden these things in Your heart; / I know that this is with You:
If I sin, You mark me, / And You do not acquit me of my iniquity;
If I am wicked, woe unto me; / If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head, / Being filled with dishonor and looking on my affliction.
And if my head should be lifted up, You would hunt me down like a lion, / And You would again demonstrate wonders on me.
You renew Your witnesses against me / And increase Your anger against me; / Attacking waves and a host are against me.
And why have You brought me out of the womb? / I should have died that no eye had seen me;
I should have been as though I had not been; / I should have been carried from birth to the grave.
Are not my days few? Cease then, / And let me alone, that I may be somewhat revived,
Before I go, and never return, / To the land of darkness and the shadow of death,
The land of gloom like deep darkness, / The shadow of death without order, / Which shines like deep darkness.
