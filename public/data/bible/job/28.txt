There is certainly a mine for silver, / And a place for gold to be refined.
Iron is taken out of the earth, / And copper is smelted from rock.
The miner sets an end to the darkness, / And to the very end he searches out / The stones of deep darkness and of gloom.
He breaks open a shaft apart from where men dwell; / They are forgotten by the foot; / They are suspended apart from men, they sway about.
The earth--from it comes forth food, / Yet underneath it, it is turned up as it were by fire.
Its stones are the place of sapphires, / And its dust has gold.
It is a path known by no bird of prey, / And the falcon's eye has not seen it.
The proud beasts have not trodden it; / The fierce lion does not pass along it.
The miner sends forth his hand into the flinty rock; / He overturns the mountains by its roots.
He cuts out channels in the rocks, / And his eye sees every precious thing.
He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, / And that which is hidden he brings out to the light.
But where shall wisdom be found? / And where is the place of understanding?
Man does not know its price, / Nor is it found in the land of the living.
The deep says, It is not in me; / And the sea says, It is not with me.
Rare gold cannot be given for it, / Nor can silver be weighed out for its price.
It cannot be balanced with the gold of Ophir, / With precious onyx or with sapphire.
Gold and glass cannot compare with it, / Nor can vessels of fine gold be exchanged for it.
Coral and crystal cannot be mentioned with it; / Indeed the acquisition of wisdom is above that of pearls.
The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it, / Nor can it be balanced with pure gold.
From where then does wisdom come? / And where is the place of understanding?
For it is hidden from the eyes of all living / And concealed from the birds of heaven.
Abaddon and Death say, / We have heard a report of it with our ears.
God understands the way to it; / He knows its place.
For He sees to the ends of the earth; / He beholds all that is under heaven.
When He gave weight to the wind / And apportioned the water by measure,
When He made a decree for the rain / And a way for the thunderbolt;
Then He saw it and declared it; / He established it and even searched it out.
And He said to man, / Indeed, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; / And to depart from evil is understanding.
