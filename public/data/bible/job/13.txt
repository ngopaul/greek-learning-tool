Indeed, my eye has seen all this; / My ear has heard and understood it.
What you know, I also know; / I am not inferior to you.
But I would speak to the Almighty, / And I desire to argue with God.
Yet you are plasterers of lies; / Physicians of no value are you all.
Oh that you would be altogether silent, / And this would be your wisdom!
Hear now my argument, / And hearken to the contentions of my lips.
Will you speak wrongly for God / And speak deceitfully for Him?
Will you be partial to Him? / Will you contend for God?
Will it be well with you when He searches you out? / Or will you deceive Him as one might deceive a man?
He will surely reprove you / If you are secretly partial.
Will not His majesty make you afraid / And His dread fall on you?
Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes; / Your defenses are defenses of clay.
Be silent before me, and I myself will speak; / And let come on me what may.
I will take my flesh in my teeth / And put my life in my hand.
Indeed, He will kill me; I have no hope. / Nevertheless I will argue my ways before Him.
This also will be my salvation, / That no profane man may come before Him.
Hear carefully my words, / And let my declaration be in your ears.
Here now, I have arranged my case; / I know that I will be vindicated.
Who will contend with me? / For then I would be silent and die.
Only do not do two things to me, / Then I will not hide from Your face:
Withdraw Your hand far from me, / And do not let Your terror frighten me.
Then call, and I will answer; / Or let me speak, and You respond to me.
How many are my iniquities and sins? / Make my transgression and my sin known to me.
Why do You hide Your face / And consider me as Your enemy?
Will You harass a driven leaf / And pursue dry chaff?
For You write bitter things against me / And cause me to inherit the iniquities of my youth;
And You put my feet in stocks / And watch all my paths; / You set a limit for the soles of my feet.
And such a one is like some rotten thing that wastes away, / Like a garment eaten by moths.
