Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,
Because of this, my disquieting thoughts answer me; / And hence my haste is in me.
I hear the reproof that humiliates me, / And the spirit of my understanding answers me.
Do you not know this from of old, / Since man was set upon the earth,
That the joyous shouting of the wicked is short, / And the rejoicing of the profane is but for a moment?
Though his arrogance goes up to heaven, / And his head touches the clouds;
Like his own dung he perishes forever; / Those who have seen him say, Where is he?
Like a dream he flies away and is not found; / Indeed he is chased away like a vision of the night.
The eye looks on him then sees him no more, / Nor does his place observe him anymore.
His children seek the favor of the poor, / And his hands return his wealth.
His bones are full of youthful vigor, / Yet it lies down with him in the dust.
Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, / Though he hides it under his tongue,
Though he favors it and will not forsake it, / But holds it in his mouth;
His food in his bowels is changed; / It is the venom of asps within him.
He swallows down riches and vomits them up; / God casts them forth from his stomach.
He sucks the poison of asps; / The tongue of the viper slays him.
He will not look on the rivers, / The streams flowing with honey and butter.
He will return what he toiled for and will not swallow it down; / And he will not rejoice according to the wealth of his trading.
For he has oppressed and abandoned the poor; / He has violently seized a house that he did not build.
Because he knew no respite in his craving, / Of that which he desired he will save nothing.
There will be nothing left of what he has devoured; / Thus his prosperity will not endure.
In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be distressed; / The hand of everyone in trouble will come against him.
In order to fill his belly, / God will send the burning fierceness of His wrath on him / And will rain it upon him as his food.
He will flee from the iron weapon, / But the bronze bow will strike him through.
He draws the arrow out, and it comes out of his body; / Indeed the glittering point goes forth from his gall. / Terrors come upon him.
Total darkness is laid up as his treasures; / A fire not fanned by man will devour him; / It will feed on what is left in his tent.
The heavens will reveal his iniquity, / And the earth will rise up against him.
The increase of his house will depart / As things swept away in the day of His wrath.
This is the wicked man's portion from God / And the inheritance decreed to him by God.
