Then Job answered and said,
How you have helped him who is without power! / How you have saved the arm of him who is without strength!
How you have counseled him who is without wisdom / And have plentifully declared sound knowledge!
To whom have you uttered words? / And whose spirit has come forth from you?
The deceased are made to tremble / Beneath the waters, and those who inhabit them.
Sheol is naked before Him, / And Abaddon has no covering.
He stretches out the north over the void; / He hangs the earth upon nothing.
He binds up the waters in His thick clouds, / And the cloud is not rent under them.
He covers the face of His throne; / He spreads His cloud over it.
He drew a circle on the surface of the waters / As a boundary of the light and the darkness.
The pillars of heaven shook / And were astounded at His rebuke.
By His power He stilled the sea, / And by His understanding He struck down Rahab.
By His Spirit the heavens became beauty; / His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; / And how small a whisper do we hear of Him! / But as for the thundering of His mightiness, who can comprehend it?
