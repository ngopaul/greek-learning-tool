Do you know the time when the mountain goats bring forth? / Can you mark the time when the hinds calve?
Can you number the months that they must fulfill? / Or do you know the time when they bring forth?
They crouch down; they give birth to their young ones; / They send forth their offspring.
Their young become strong; they grow up in the open field; / They go forth and do not return to them.
Who has sent out the wild ass free? / Or who has loosed the bonds of the swift ass,
Whose home I have made the wilderness, / And the salt land, his dwelling place?
He scorns the tumult of the city; / He does not hear the shouts of the driver.
He searches out the mountains for his pasture / And seeks after every green thing.
Will the wild ox be willing to serve you / Or spend the night by your manger?
Can you bind the wild ox to the furrows with his ropes? / Or will he plow the valleys behind you?
Will you trust in him because his strength is great? / Or will you leave your labor to him?
Will you have confidence in him that he will bring in your seed / And gather your grain to your threshing floor?
The wings of the ostrich flap joyously: / Are they the pinion and plumage of lovingkindness?
For she leaves her eggs on the earth / And warms them in the dust.
And she forgets that a foot may crush them / Or that an animal of the field may trample them.
She is hard with her children, as if they were not hers; / Though her labor may be in vain, she has no fear;
Because God has caused her to forget wisdom / And has not appointed understanding to her.
At that time when she lifts herself up on high, / She scorns the horse and its rider.
Have you given the horse his might? / Have you clothed his neck with the quivering mane?
Have you made him to leap like a locust? / His majestic snorting is terrible.
He paws in the valley, / And he rejoices in his strength; / He goes forth to meet weapons.
He laughs at fear and is not dismayed, / And he does not turn back from the sword.
A quiver of arrows rattles against him, / The flashing spear and the javelin.
With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground, / And he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
As often as the trumpet sounds, he says, Aha! / And from afar he smells the battle, / The thundering of captains and the shouting.
Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, / Stretching his wings to the south?
Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up / And makes his nest on high?
On the cliff he dwells and makes his lodging, / Upon the point of the cliff and the stronghold.
From there he spies out food; / His eyes gaze on it from afar.
And his young ones suck up the blood; / And where the slain are, there he is.
