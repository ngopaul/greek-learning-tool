Man, born of woman, / Is of few days and full of trouble.
He comes forth like a blossom and is cut down; / He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.
And do You open Your eyes upon such a one / And bring me into litigation with You?
Who can bring a clean thing out from the unclean? / No one!
Since his days are determined, / And the number of his months is with You; / Since You have appointed his bounds, and he cannot go beyond;
Look away from him that he may rest, / Until he fulfills his day like a hired hand.
For there is hope for a tree: / If it is cut down, it will sprout again, / And its tender shoot will not cease.
Though its root grows old in the earth, / And its trunk dies in the dirt,
At the scent of water it will bud / And will produce branches like a new plant.
But a man dies and is laid low; / Yes, a man expires, and then where is he?
The waters of the sea recede, / And the river becomes parched and dried up:
So a man lies down and does not rise up; / Until the heavens are no more, he will not awake, / Nor will he be roused from his sleep.
Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol, / That You would conceal me until Your anger has passed, / That You would set me an appointed time and remember me!
If a man dies, will he live again? / All the days of my service I would wait, / Until a change for me should come.
You would call, and I would answer You; / You would long after the work of Your hands.
For now You number my steps. / Do You not watch over my sin?
My transgression has been sealed up in a bag, / And You have fastened up my iniquity.
However the mountain falls and crumbles, / And the rock moves from its place;
Waters wear away stones; / Their torrents wash away the dust of the earth: / So You destroy the hope of man.
You prevail forever against him, and he passes away; / You change his countenance and send him away.
His sons gain honor, but he does not know it; / And they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it.
Only the pain of his own flesh does he feel, / And his own soul mourns for him.
