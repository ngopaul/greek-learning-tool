Then Job answered and said,
I do indeed know that it is so. / But how can a man be righteous before God?
If he is pleased to contend with Him, / He cannot answer Him one thing in a thousand.
He is wise in heart and mighty in strength--/ Who has ever resisted Him and come through whole?--
He who removes mountains, and they do not know it, / When He overturns them in His anger;
Who shakes the earth from its place, / And its pillars shake;
Who commands the sun, and it does not rise, / And seals up the stars;
Who alone stretched forth the heavens / And trod upon the heights of the sea;
Who made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, / And the chambers of the south;
Who does great things that cannot be searched, / Indeed, wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered.
Indeed, He passes by me, but I do not see Him; / And He goes by, but I do not perceive Him.
Indeed, He snatches away; who can stop Him? / Who can say to Him, What are You doing?
God does not turn back His anger; / Under Him Rahab's helpers stoop.
How then can I answer Him / And choose my words properly with Him?
I, though righteous, could not answer Him; / I could only plead for mercy before my Judge.
If I called out and He answered me, / I do not believe that He would hearken to my voice.
For He crushes me with a whirlwind / And multiplies my wounds without cause.
He does not permit me to catch my breath, / But fills me with bitterness.
If we speak of strength, indeed, He is mighty! / Or if of judgment, Who, says He, can appoint Me a time?
Though I am righteous, my mouth would condemn me; / Though I am perfect, it would prove me perverse.
I am perfect; I do not regard my soul; / I despise my life.
It is all one; therefore I say, / He destroys the perfect and the wicked.
If some scourge suddenly kills, / He derides the despair of the innocent.
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; / He covers the faces of its judges. / If not He, then who is it?
And my days are swifter than a running messenger; / They flee away, they do not see good;
They go by like reed boats, / Like an eagle swooping on the prey.
If I say, I will forget my complaint, / I will put off my sad countenance and look cheerful;
I fear all my pains: / I know that You will not hold me innocent.
I will be accounted wicked; / Why then do I labor in vain?
If I wash myself with soap / And cleanse my hands with lye,
Yet You will plunge me into the pit, / And my own garments will abhor me.
For He is not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him, / That we should enter into litigation together.
There is no referee between us, / Who may lay his hand upon us both.
Let Him take His rod away from me, / And let not the dread of Him terrify me;
Then I would speak and not be afraid of Him; / For I am not such.
