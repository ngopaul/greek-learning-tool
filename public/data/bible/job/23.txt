Then Job answered and said,
Today also my complaint is bitter; / My stroke is heavy because of my groaning.
Oh that I knew where I might find Him, / That I might come to His seat!
I would present my cause in order before Him, / And I would fill my mouth with arguments.
I would know the words which He would answer me, / And I would understand what He would speak to me.
Would He contend with me in the greatness of His power? / No; but He would give heed to me.
There the upright man can argue with Him; / So I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
Behold, I go forward, but He is not there; / And backward, but I do not perceive Him;
To the left, where He acts, but I cannot look on Him; / He hides Himself on the right, so I cannot see Him.
But He knows the way that I take; / Should He try me, I would come forth as gold.
My foot has held fast to His steps; / I have kept His way and have not turned aside.
As for the commandment of His lips, I have not turned back from it; / I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my apportioned food.
But He is of one mind, and who can turn Him? / And what His soul desires, that will He do.
For He performs what has been appointed to me, / And many such things are with Him.
Therefore I am terrified at His presence; / I consider and am in dread of Him.
So God has made my heart faint, / And the Almighty has terrified me;
Because I was not cut off before the darkness, / Nor did He cover the deep darkness from my face.
