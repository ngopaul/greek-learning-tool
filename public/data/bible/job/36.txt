And Elihu added this and said,
Bear with me a little, and I will show you; / For there is more to say for God.
I will bring my knowledge from afar / And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
For truly my words are not false; / One perfect in knowledge is with you.
Indeed, God is mighty and does not despise; / He is mighty in strength of understanding.
He does not preserve the wicked man alive, / But gives justice to the afflicted.
He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; / And with kings on the throne, / He sets them forever, and they are exalted.
And if they are bound in fetters, / If they are caught in the cords of affliction,
He shows them their work / And their transgressions, that they have acted arrogantly.
He also opens their ear to instruction / And commands that they return from iniquity.
If they hear and serve Him, / They will spend their days in prosperity / And their years in pleasantness.
But if they do not hear, they will pass away by the sword / And die without knowledge.
But those who are profane in heart lay up anger; / They do not cry for help when He binds them.
They die in youth, / And their life ends among the most defiled.
He rescues the afflicted by their affliction / And opens their ear through oppression.
Indeed He allures you from the jaws of distress / Into a spacious place, where there is no constraint; / And what is upon your table is full of fatness.
But you are filled with the judgment of the wicked; / Judgment and litigation have taken hold of you.
Beware lest wrath allures you into scoffing, / And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
Will your cry keep you from being in distress, / Or all the forces of your strength?
Do not long for the night, / When people are taken from their place.
Take heed; do not turn toward iniquity; / For you have chosen this rather than affliction.
Indeed, God is exalted in His power: / Who is a teacher like Him?
Who has appointed His way for Him? / And who says, You have done wrong?
Remember to magnify His work, / Of which men sing.
All mankind has gazed on it; / Man beholds it from afar.
Indeed, God is great, and we do not know Him; / The number of His years we also cannot search out.
For He draws up the drops of water / Which distill into rain from His mist,
Which the skies pour down / And drop upon man abundantly.
Can they indeed understand the spreading of the clouds, / The thunderings of His pavilion?
Indeed, He scatters His lightning around Him / And covers the roots of the sea.
For by these He judges the peoples; / He gives food in abundance.
He fills His hands with lightning / And commands it to strike the mark.
Its noise tells of Him; / The cattle as well tell concerning Him who is coming.
