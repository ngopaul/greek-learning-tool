And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
Can a man of might be of any use to God? / No, a man of insight is of use only to himself.
Is it a matter of delight to the Almighty that you are righteous? / Or is it a gain to Him that you make your ways perfect?
Is it because of your fear of Him that He reproves you, / That He enters into judgment with you?
Is not your wickedness great, / And is there no end to your iniquities?
For you have taken pledges from your brothers without cause / And stripped the naked of their clothing.
You have not given water to the weary to drink, / And you have withheld bread from the hungry.
And as for the man of power, the earth was his; / And the man of honor dwelt in it.
You have sent away the widows empty, / And the arms of the orphans have been crushed.
Therefore snares are all around you; / And sudden dread troubles you,
Or darkness, so that you cannot see; / And an abundance of waters covers you.
Is not God at the height of heaven? / And look at the highest of the stars, how lofty they are!
And you say, What does God know? / Can He judge through the deep darkness?
Thick clouds are a covering to Him, so He cannot see; / And He walks upon the circle of the heavens.
Will you keep the old way, / Which wicked men have trodden?
Such were snatched away before their time, / Whose foundation was poured forth like a stream;
Who said to God, Depart from us; / And, What can the Almighty accomplish for us?
Yet He fills their houses with good things. / But the counsel of the wicked is far from Him.
The righteous see and rejoice, / And the innocent deride them,
Saying, Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, / And the remnant of them the fire has devoured.
Be well disposed to Him and at peace with Him; / By such, good will come upon you.
Receive instruction from His mouth, / And lay up His words in your heart.
If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up. / If you put injustice far away from your tents,
And place your gold nuggets in the dust / And your gold of Ophir in the stones of the brooks,
Then the Almighty will be your gold nuggets / And precious silver to you.
For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, / And you will lift up your countenance to God.
You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; / And you will repay your vows.
You will also decree something, and it will be established for you; / And light will shine on your ways.
When they cast you down, you will say, I am up! / And the lowly person He will save.
He will deliver him who is not innocent; / Yes, you will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.
