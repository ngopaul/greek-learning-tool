I made a covenant with my eyes; / How then can I gaze upon a virgin?
What then is the portion from God above, / Or the inheritance of the Almighty on high?
Is it not calamity for the unjust / And misfortune for the workers of iniquity?
Does He not see my ways / And count all my steps?
If I have walked with falsehood, / And my foot has hastened after deceit--
Let Him weigh me in a righteous balance, / And let God know my integrity--
If my step has turned from the way, / And my heart has gone after my own eyes, / And if any spot has stuck to my hands;
May I sow and another eat; / Indeed may my produce be rooted up.
If my heart has been enticed into following after a woman, / Or I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door;
May my wife grind for another, / And may others kneel over her.
For that would have been a heinous act, / And it would be wickedness, to be punished by the judges.
For it is a fire that devours to Abaddon / And would root up all my increase.
If I have despised the cause of my servant or my maid / When they contended with me,
What then will I do when God rises up? / And when He visits me, what will I answer Him?
Did not He who made me in the womb make him? / And was it not One who fashioned us in the womb?
If I have withheld the poor from their desire, / Or have let the eyes of the widow fail,
Or have eaten my morsel alone / Without the orphan eating of it--
Rather, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, / And from my mother's womb I guided the widow--
If I have seen someone perishing from lack of clothing / Or that the needy had no covering;
If his loins have not blessed me, / And he has not been made warm with the fleece of my sheep;
If I have raised my hand against the orphan / Because I saw that I had support among those in the gate;
May my shoulder blade fall from the shoulder, / And may my arm be broken at the elbow.
For calamity from God is dreadful to me, / And because of His majesty I can do nothing.
If I have made gold my hope, / And have called fine gold my confidence;
If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great / And because my hand had acquired much;
If I have looked at the sun when it shone / Or the moon going on in splendor,
And my heart has been secretly enticed, / And my mouth has kissed my hand;
It too would be wickedness, to be punished by the judges, / For I would have denied God above.
If I have rejoiced at the misfortune of him who hated me, / Or have exulted when evil found him--
Rather, I have not allowed my mouth to sin / By asking for his life with a curse--
If the men of my tent have not said, / Who can find one who has not been filled with our master's meat?--
The sojourner has not lodged in the street; / I have opened my doors to the highway--
If I have covered my transgressions as Adam did / By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
Because I so dreaded the great multitude, / And the contempt of the families so frightened me, / That I was silent and did not go out my door--
Oh, that I had someone to hear me! / Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me. / And let my accuser write up the charge.
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; / I would bind it onto me like a crown;
I would declare to Him the number of my steps; / Like a prince I would approach Him!
If my land cries out against me, / And its furrows weep together;
If I have eaten its strength without money, / And have caused its owners to lose their life;
May thorns come forth instead of wheat, / And pungent weeds instead of barley. / The words of Job are ended.
