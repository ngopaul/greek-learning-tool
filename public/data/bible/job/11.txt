Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,
Should a multitude of words not be answered? / And should a man of much talk be justified?
Shall your empty talk silence men? / And will you mock, and there be none to shame you?
For you say, My doctrine is pure, / And I am clean in Your eyes.
But, oh, that God would speak / And open His lips to you,
And that He would tell you the secrets of wisdom! / For there are two sides to sound reason. / Know then that God has forgotten some of your iniquity.
Can you find out the depths of God? / Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?
It is the height of heaven--what can you do? / It is deeper than Sheol--what can you know?
Its measure is longer than that of the earth / And broader than the sea.
If He passes by and imprisons / And summons an assembly, who can stop Him?
For He knows men of falsehood, / And He sees iniquity without considering it.
But an empty-headed man acquires intelligence / When the foal of a wild ass is born as a man.
If you would set your heart right / And stretch your hands out to Him--
If there is iniquity in your hand, put it far away, / And do not let wrong dwell in your tents--
Then indeed you would lift up your face without blemish, / And you would be steadfast and would not be afraid.
For you will forget your misery; / You will remember it as waters that have passed away.
And your time here will rise more brightly than the noonday; / Dark though it may be, it will be like the morning.
And you will be secure, for there is hope; / And you will search about and lie down in security.
Indeed you will lie down, and there will be none to terrify you; / And many will entreat your favor.
But the eyes of the wicked will fail, / And fleeing will be lost to them, / And their hope will be to breathe out their life.
