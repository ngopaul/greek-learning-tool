And Jehovah answered Job and said,
Shall one who finds fault contend with the Almighty? / Let him who argues with God answer it.
Then Job answered Jehovah and said,
Indeed, I am worthless. What shall I reply to You? / I lay my hand over my mouth.
I have spoken once, and I will not answer; / And twice, and I will proceed no further.
And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,
Gird up now your loins like a mighty man; / For I will ask of you, and you shall inform Me.
Will you indeed annul My judgment? / Will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?
Or do you have an arm like God's, / And can you thunder with a voice like His?
Deck yourself now with majesty and excellency, / And array yourself with honor and splendor.
Pour forth the overflowings of your anger, / And look upon everyone who is proud, and abase him.
Look upon everyone who is proud; bring him down; / And tread down the wicked where they stand.
Hide them in the dust together; / Bind their faces in the hidden place.
Then even I will praise you, / That your own right hand can save you.
Behold now the behemoth, which I made as well as you: / He eats grass like the ox.
Behold now, his strength is in his loins, / And his power is in the muscles of his belly.
He bends his tail like a cedar; / The sinews of his thighs knit together.
His bones are like bronze tubes; / His limbs, like iron bars.
He is the first of God's ways; / Only his Maker can approach him with His sword.
For the mountains yield food for him, / Where every animal of the field plays.
Under the lotus plants he lies down, / In the covert of the reed and the marsh.
The lotus plants cover him with their shade; / The willows of the brook surround him.
Indeed, if a river overflows, he does not tremble; / He is confident, though the Jordan rushes against his mouth.
Will anyone catch him while he is watching, / Or pierce his nose with a snare?
