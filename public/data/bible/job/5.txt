Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you? / And to which of the holy ones will you turn?
Surely vexation slays the fool, / And jealousy kills the simpleton.
I have seen the fool taking root, / But suddenly I cursed his habitation.
His children are far from safety, / And they are crushed in the gate; and there is no one to deliver them.
The hungry eat his harvest / And even take it out from the thorns, / And the thirsty pant after his wealth.
For evil does not come forth from the dust, / Nor does trouble spring forth from the ground.
But man is born unto trouble, / Just as sparks fly upward.
But as for me, I would seek after God, / And I would commit my cause to God,
Who does great things that cannot be searched, / Wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered;
Who gives rain upon the surface of the earth / And sends water upon the surface of the fields;
Who sets on high those who are lowly / And puts those who mourn safely above all.
He frustrates the devices of the crafty, / So that their hands achieve no enterprise.
He seizes the wise in their own craftiness, / And the counsel of the wily is brought to a sudden end.
By day they encounter darkness, / And at noon they grope about as in the night.
But He saves the needy from the sword of their mouth, / From the hand of the strong.
Thus the poor have hope, / And Injustice stops her mouth.
Indeed, blessed is the man whom God corrects; / Therefore do not reject the chastening of the Almighty.
For He wounds, but He binds up; / He strikes, but His hands heal.
In six troubles He will deliver you; / Indeed in seven no evil will touch you.
In famine He will redeem you from death, / And in battle, from the power of the sword.
From the scourge of the tongue you will be hidden, / And you will not be afraid of destruction when it comes.
At destruction and at famine you will laugh, / And you will not be afraid of the animals of the earth.
For you will be in an alliance with the stones of the field, / And the animals of the field will be at peace with you.
And you will know that your tent is at peace, / And you will inspect your fold and miss nothing.
And you will know that your seed will be great, / And your offspring like the grass of the earth.
You will come to the grave at a ripe old age, / Like a shock of grain coming up in its season.
This is it. We have searched it out; it is so. / Hear then and know it for yourself.
