Can you draw out leviathan with a hook, / Or press down his tongue with a cord?
Can you put a rope in his nose, / Or pierce his jaw with a hook?
Will he make many supplications unto you, / Or speak soft words to you?
Will he make a covenant with you / That you would take him as a servant forever?
Will you play with him as with a bird, / Or bind him for your maidens?
Will the traders bargain over him? / Will they divide him up among merchants?
Can you fill his skin with harpoons, / Or his head with fishing spears?
Lay your hand on him, / And remember the battle--you will never do it again!
Indeed, any hope for him is vain; / Will not one be even cast down at the sight of him?
No one is so fierce as to stir him up; / Who then is he who would stand before Me?
Who has first given to Me that I should repay him? / Whatever is under the whole heaven is Mine.
I will not be silent about his limbs / Or about the account of his mighty deeds or about the beauty of his frame.
Who can strip off his outer garment? / Who can go within his double jaws?
Who can open the doors of his face? / Around his teeth is terror.
His pride is his rows of scales, / Shut up as with a tight seal.
One is so near the other / That the air cannot pass between them.
Each is joined to the other; / They stick together and cannot be separated.
His sneezes flash forth light, / And his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.
Out of his mouth go forth flaming torches; / Sparks of fire leap out.
Out of his nostrils comes smoke, / As from a boiling pot and burning rushes.
His breath kindles coals, / And a flame comes from his mouth.
In his neck abides strength, / And terror dances before him.
The folds of his flesh are joined together; / They are firm upon him and immovable.
His heart is as firm as stone, / Indeed as firm as the lower millstone.
At his rising up, the mighty fear; / They are beside themselves with consternation.
The sword that reaches him cannot avail, / Nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
He considers iron shafts as straw, / And bronze ones as rotted wood.
The arrow does not make him flee; / With him slingstones turn to stubble.
Clubs are considered as stubble; / He laughs at the quivering javelin.
His underparts are like sharp potsherds; / He spreads himself like a threshing sledge upon the mire.
He makes the deep boil like a cauldron; / He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
Behind him he makes a shining wake; / One would think the deep to be white-haired.
On earth there is none his equal, / Who is made without fear.
He beholds everything that is high; / He is king over all the sons of pride.
