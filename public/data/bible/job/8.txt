Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
How long will you speak these things? / And how long will the words of your mouth be like a mighty wind?
Does God pervert justice? / Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
If your children have sinned against Him, / He has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.
If you seek earnestly after God / And make supplication unto the Almighty,
If you are pure and upright, / Then surely He will rouse Himself for you / And restore well-being to your righteous habitation.
And though your beginning was small, / Your end will be very great.
For inquire now of the former generation, / And attend to what their fathers have sought out.
For we are of yesterday and know nothing, / Because our days upon the earth are a shadow.
Will they not teach you and talk to you / And utter forth words from their heart?
Can papyrus shoot up without marsh? / Can reeds grow without water?
While it is still in its greenness and not cut down, / It withers before all other grasses.
So are the paths of all who forget God; / And the hope of the profane perishes,
Whose confidence is cut off, / And whose trust is a spider's web.
He leans upon his house, but it will not stand; / He holds fast to it, but it will not endure.
He is full of sap before the sun, / And his shoots go forth over his garden.
His roots are entwined around a stone heap; / He looks upon a place of stones.
If one destroys him from his place, / Then it denies him, saying, I have not seen you.
Indeed, that is the joy of his way; / And others spring forth out of the dust.
Indeed, God will not reject a perfect man, / Nor will He support evildoers.
He will yet fill your mouth with laughter / And your lips with shouting.
Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, / And the tent of the wicked will be no more.
