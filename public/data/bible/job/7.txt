Does not man have a term of hard service on earth? / And are his days not like the days of a hired hand?
Like a servant who longs for the shade, / And like a hired hand who waits for his pay,
So I am made to inherit months of vanity, / And nights of trouble are appointed to me.
If I lie down, I say, / When will I arise? But the evening is long, / And I am full of tossings until the dawn.
My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt clods; / My skin crusts and then oozes again.
My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle / And are spent without hope.
Remember that my life is a breath; / My eye will not see good again.
The eye of him who sees me will not look on me; / Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.
The cloud is consumed and goes away: / Likewise he who goes down into Sheol does not come up.
He returns no more to his house, / Nor does his place know him anymore.
For my part, I also will not restrain my mouth; / I will speak in the distress of my spirit; / I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Am I the sea, or a sea serpent, / That You must set a watch over me?
When I say, My bed will comfort me, / My couch will bear up my complaint;
Then You scare me with dreams / And terrify me with visions,
So that my soul would choose strangulation / And death rather than my bones.
I loathe life; I would not live forever. / Leave me alone, for my days are a mere breath.
What is mortal man that You magnify him, / And that You consider him,
And that You visit him every morning, / You try him every moment?
How long before You look away from me, / Before You abandon me until I swallow my spittle?
If I have sinned, what have I done to You, O Watcher of man? / Why have You made me Your target so that I have become a burden to You?
And why do You not forgive my transgression / And take away my iniquity? / For now I may lie down in the dust; / And You will seek me out, and I will not be.
