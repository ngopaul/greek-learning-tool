Then Job again took up his discourse and said,
As God lives, who has taken away my right, / And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul,
As long as my breath is in me / And the spirit of God is in my nostrils,
Surely my lips will not speak anything wrong, / Nor will my tongue utter deceit.
Far be it from me to declare you righteous! / Until I die, I will not put away my integrity from me.
To my righteousness I will hold fast, I will not let it go; / My heart does not reproach me for any of my days.
May my enemy be like a wicked man, / And may he who rises up against me be like someone unjust.
For what is the hope of the profane man when God cuts him off, / When He takes away his soul?
Will God hear his cry / When distress comes upon him?
Does he take delight in the Almighty? / Will he call upon God at all times?
I will teach you about the hand of God; / What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
Indeed, all of you have seen it yourselves; / And why then have you become altogether vain?
This is the portion with God for a wicked man, / And the inheritance that oppressors receive from the Almighty:
If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; / And his offspring will not be satisfied with bread;
Those who remain of him will be buried in death, / And his widows will not lament.
Though he heaps up silver like dust / And prepares garments like clay,
He may prepare them, but the righteous will wear them; / And the innocent will divide the silver.
He builds his house as a moth does / And like a hut that a watchman makes.
He lies down rich but will be rich no more; / He opens his eyes, and he is not.
Terrors overtake him like waters; / At night a whirlwind steals him away.
The east wind carries him off, and he goes; / And it sweeps him out of his place.
And God hurls at him and does not spare; / He hastily flees from His hand.
Men clap their hands at him / And hiss him out of his place.
