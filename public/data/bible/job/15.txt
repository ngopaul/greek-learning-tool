And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
Should a wise man answer with the knowledge of wind, / And should he fill his belly with the east wind?
Should he argue with useless talk / And with words by which he cannot avail?
Indeed you do away with the fear of God / And restrain meditation before God.
For your iniquity instructs your mouth, / And you choose the tongue of the crafty.
Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; / And your own lips testify against you.
Are you the first man born? / Or were you brought forth before the hills?
Did you listen in on the secret council of God? / And do you limit wisdom to yourself?
What do you know that we do not know? / What do you understand that is not with us?
Both the grayheaded and the aged are among us, / Older than your father.
Are the consolations of God too small for you, / Or the word spoken gently to you?
Why does your heart take you away? / And why do your eyes flash,
That you turn your spirit against God / And let words go forth from your mouth?
What is mortal man, that he can be clean, / Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?
Indeed, He puts no trust in His holy ones; / Even the heavens are not clean in His eyes.
How much less one who is abominable and corrupt! / How much less a man who drinks wrong like water!
I will tell you; hear me; / And what I have seen, that will I recount,
What wise men have declared, / And have not hidden, from their fathers;
To whom alone the land was given, / And no stranger passed in their midst:
For all his days the wicked man travails in pain, / And numbered years are stored up for the ruthless man.
The sound of terrors is in his ears; / While he is at peace, the destroyer will come upon him.
He does not believe that he will return from the darkness, / And he is spied out for the sword.
He wanders for bread--where is it? / He knows that the day of darkness is ready at hand.
Distress and straits terrify him; / They prevail against him, like a king prepared for the attack;
Because he stretched out his hand against God, / And against the Almighty he acted mightily,
Running against Him with a stiff neck, / With the thick bosses of his shield;
Because he covered his face with his fatness / And gathered fat upon his loins;
And he dwelt in desolated cities, / In houses which should not have been inhabited, / Which were appointed to become heaps.
He will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure; / Nor will his produce bend down to the earth.
He will not go away from darkness; / The flame will dry up his shoots, / And by the breath of His mouth he will go away.
Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; / For vanity will be his recompense.
It will be fully paid before his day, / And his branch will not be flourishing.
He will shake off his unripe grapes like a vine, / And he will cast off his blossom like an olive tree.
For the company of the profane will be barren, / And fire will devour the tents of bribery.
They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, / And their heart prepares deceit.
