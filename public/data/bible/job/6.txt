Then Job answered and said,
Oh that my vexation were weighed indeed, / And that my ruin were lifted onto the scales together with it!
For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; / Therefore my words have been rash.
For the arrows of the Almighty are in me, / The poison of which my spirit drinks up; / The terrors of God are arrayed against me.
Does the wild ass bray over its grass? / Or does the ox low over its fodder?
Is what is savorless eaten without salt? / Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
My soul refuses to touch them; / They are like putrid food to me.
Oh that I might have my request, / And that God would grant me what I long for;
That God would be willing to crush me; / That He would release His hand and cut me off!
Then there would still be comfort for me; / And I would exult, even in writhing pain that does not spare, / That I did not deny the words of the Holy One.
What is my strength, that I should wait? / And what is my end, that I should be patient?
Is my strength the strength of stones? / Or is my flesh bronze?
Is there any help for me at all within me, / And has wisdom been driven away from me?
To him who is fainting there should be kindness from his friend, / Else he will forsake the fear of the Almighty.
My brothers have dealt as treacherously as a desert brook, / As the rivulets of the desert brooks that pass away,
Which are turbid because of the ice, / And into which the snow hides itself.
When they are scorched, they are completely consumed; / When it is hot, they are dried up from their place.
Caravans divert their ways for them; / They go up into the waste and perish.
The caravans of Tema look for them; / The companies of Sheba long for them.
They are put to shame because they are confident; / They go there and are confounded.
So now you have become such; / You see a terrible thing and are afraid.
Have I said, Give me something? / Or, Pay a bribe for me out of your wealth?
Or, Deliver me from the hand of the adversary? / Or, From the hand of the oppressors redeem me?
Teach me, and I will be silent; / Cause me to understand how I have erred.
How forceful are upright words! / But what does this reproving from you reprove?
Do you think you can reprove words? / But the words of a desperate man are for the wind.
You would even cast lots over the orphan / And bargain over your friend.
Now then be pleased to look upon me, / For surely I will not lie to your face.
Turn now; let there be no injustice. / Indeed turn; my righteousness is still here.
Is there any injustice on my tongue? / Can my palate not discern calamities?
