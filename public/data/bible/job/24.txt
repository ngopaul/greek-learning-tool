Why are times of judgment not stored up by the Almighty? / And why do those who know Him not see His days?
Some remove landmarks; / They seize the flock and pasture them.
They drive away the donkey of the fatherless / And take the widow's ox as a pledge.
They turn the needy out of the way; / The poor of the land are made to hide together.
Indeed, like wild asses in the desert, / They go forth to their work, / Diligently seeking some prey; / The wilderness provides them food for their children.
In the field they harvest their fodder, / And they glean the vintage of the wicked.
They spend the night naked, without clothing; / And have no covering in the cold.
They are wet from the mountain showers, / And for lack of shelter they embrace the rock.
Some pluck the fatherless from the breast, / And what the poor has on, as a pledge.
They go about naked, without clothing; / And being hungry, they take up the sheaves.
Between their walls they press out oil; / They tread the winepresses yet suffer thirst.
From the city men groan, / And the soul of the wounded cries out; / Yet God does not regard the folly.
These are among those who rebel against the light; / They are not acquainted with its ways, / Nor do they abide in its paths.
The murderer rises at dawn; / He kills the poor and the needy; / And at night he is like a thief.
The eye of the adulterer also watches for the twilight, / Saying, Not an eye will see me; / And he disguises his face.
They dig through houses in the dark; / By day they shut themselves in: / They do not know the light.
For morning is to all of them like the shadow of death, / Because they are acquainted with the terrors of the shadow of death.
Swift are they upon the face of the waters; / Their portion is cursed in the earth; / There is none who turns toward the vineyards.
Drought and heat snatch the snow water, / As Sheol snatches those who have sinned.
The womb forgets him; / The worm finds him sweet; / He is remembered no more; / And wrongdoing is broken like a tree.
He despoils the barren woman who does not bear, / And does no good for the widow.
But God preserves the mighty by His power; / He arises, and no one is certain of life.
He grants a man to be secure, and he rests on it; / And His eyes are upon their ways.
They are exalted a little while, then they are no more; / And they are brought low; like all others, they are gathered in / And are cut off like the tops of the ears of grain.
And if it is not so, then who will prove me a liar / And bring my words to nought?
