After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
And Job responded and said,
Let the day on which I was born perish, / And the night which said, A man has been conceived.
Let that day be darkness; / Let God not seek it from above, / Nor let light shine upon it.
Let darkness and the shadow of death reclaim it; / Let a cloud dwell upon it; / Let the things that blacken the day terrify it.
As for that night, let deep darkness take hold of it; / Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; / Let it not come up in the number of the months.
Behold, let that night be barren; / Let no joyous shout come in it.
Let those curse it who curse the day, / Who are ready to rouse leviathan.
Let its predawn stars be dark; / Let it wait for light and there be none, / And do not let it see the eyelids of the dawn.
For it did not shut up the doors of the womb that bore me, / Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
Why did I not die at birth, / Come forth from the womb and expire?
Why did the knees receive me? / And why the breasts, that I should suck?
For now I would have lain down and been undisturbed; / I would have slept; then I would have been at rest
With kings and counselors of the earth, / Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;
Or with princes who had gold, / Who filled their houses with silver.
Or like a miscarriage that has been concealed, I would not have been, / Like infants that do not see the light.
There the wicked cease from their troubling, / And there the weary rest.
Captives are altogether at ease; / They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.
The small and the great are there, / And the servant is free from his master.
Why does He give light to him who suffers / And life to the bitter in soul,
Who wait for death, but it is not there; / And dig for it more than for hidden treasures;
Who rejoice to the point of exultation / And are glad when they have found the grave;
To the man whose way is hidden / And whom God has hedged in?
For my sighing comes as my food, / And my groaning pours out like water.
For I dread something, and it comes upon me; / And what I fear comes to me.
I have no ease and I have no quiet / And I have no rest, but trouble comes.
