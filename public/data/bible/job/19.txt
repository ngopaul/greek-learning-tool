Then Job answered and said,
How long will you grieve my soul / And crush me with your words?
These ten times you have reproached me; / You are not ashamed to deal wrongly with me.
And be it that I have erred, / My error remains with me.
If you indeed magnify yourselves against me / And use my reproach in argument against me,
Know then that God has subverted my cause / And compassed me about with His net.
Indeed, I cry out, Violence! and I am not answered; / I call for help, and there is no justice.
He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass; / And He has put darkness upon my paths.
He has stripped my glory from me / And taken away the crown on my head.
He has broken me all around, and I am gone; / And He has plucked up my hope like a tree.
He has also kindled His anger against me, / And in Himself He considers me as His adversary.
His troops come together / And cast up their highway against me / And encamp all around my tent.
He has removed my brothers far from me, / And those who know me are wholly estranged from me.
My relatives have failed me, / And my acquaintances have forgotten me.
Those who sojourn in my house and my maids consider me as a stranger; / I am a foreigner in their eyes.
To my servant I call out, but he does not answer; / I entreat him with my mouth.
My breath is strange to my wife; / And my supplications, to the children of my mother's womb.
Even little children despise me: / I arise and they speak against me.
All the men whom I take counsel with abhor me, / And those whom I love have turned against me.
My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh, / And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
Pity me, pity me, O my friends; / For the hand of God has touched me.
Why do you persecute me as God does / And are not satisfied with eating my flesh?
Oh, that my words were now written! / Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!
That with an iron pen and with lead / They were engraved in rock forever!
But I know that my Redeemer lives, / And at the last He will stand upon the earth;
And after this body of mine is destroyed, / Outside my flesh I will look on God,
Whom I, even I, will look on for myself, / And my eyes will see; I, and no other. / My inward parts that long for God are consumed within me.
If you say, How will we persecute him? / For the root of the matter is found in him;
Be fearful of the sword, / For wrath brings the punishment of the sword, / That you may know that there is a judgment.
