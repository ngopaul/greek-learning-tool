Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
If one attempts a word with you, will you be wearied by it? / But who can refrain from speaking?
Indeed, you have instructed many, / And you have strengthened the weak hands.
Your words have raised up him who was stumbling, / And you have made the bowing knees firm.
But now it comes to you, and you are wearied by it; / It touches you, and you are disturbed.
Is not your fear of God your confidence, / And the integrity of your ways your hope?
Remember now, who, being innocent, has ever perished? / And where have the upright ever been cut off?
According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity / And those who sow trouble reap the same.
By the breath of God they perish, / And by the blast of His anger they are consumed.
The roaring of the lion and the sound of the fierce lion / And the teeth of the young lions are broken;
The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, / And the whelps of the lioness are scattered.
But a matter has stolen in unto me, / And my ear has received a whisper of it.
In perplexing thoughts of the night visions, / When deep sleep falls upon men,
Dread came upon me, and trembling, / And caused all my bones to dread.
And a spirit passed before my face; / The hair of my flesh bristled.
It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; / A form stood before my eyes; / I heard a murmur of a voice:
Can a mortal man be more righteous than God? / Can a man be purer than his Maker?
If He puts no trust in His servants, / And He charges His angels with error,
How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, / Whose foundation is in dust, / Who are crushed like a moth!
From morning to evening they are smashed to pieces; / Without any considering it, they continually perish.
Should their tent cord be plucked up within them, / They die, and not in wisdom.
