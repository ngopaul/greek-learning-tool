At this, too, my heart trembles / And leaps from its place.
Hear attentively the noise of His voice / And the sound that goes forth from His mouth.
He sends it forth under the whole heaven, / And His lightning unto the ends of the earth.
After it a voice roars; / He thunders with the voice of His majesty / And does not withhold the lightning / When His voice is heard.
God thunders wondrously with His voice; / He does great things that we cannot comprehend.
For He says to the snow, Fall on the earth, / And to the rain shower and His mighty showers of rain.
He seals the hand of every man, / That all men may know His doing.
Then the beast enters its lair / And remains in its dens.
Out of its chamber comes the whirlwind, / And from scattering winds, cold.
From the breath of God ice is yielded, / And the expanse of waters is frozen.
He also loads the thick clouds with moisture; / He scatters His lightning clouds;
And they turn about by His guidance, / That they may accomplish / All that He has commanded them / Upon the surface of the inhabited earth;
Whether for scourge or for His land / Or for lovingkindness' sake, He causes it to happen.
Give ear to this, Job; / Stand still and consider the wondrous acts of God.
Do you know how God lays His charge upon them / And causes His lightning clouds to shine?
Do you know about the balancing of the thick clouds, / The wondrous acts of Him who is perfect in knowledge?
You whose garments heat up / When, because of the south wind, the earth is still,
Can you spread out the skies with Him, / The skies which are as hard as a molten mirror?
Teach us what to say to Him; / We cannot arrange our words because of the darkness.
Should it be said to Him, I will speak? / Or should a man say that he will be swallowed up?
But now men do not look at the light, / Which is brilliant in the skies / When the wind has passed and cleared them.
Out of the north comes golden splendor; / Upon God is the awesomeness of majesty.
The Almighty--we cannot find Him out; / He is excellent in power, / And justice and the abundance of righteousness He will not damage.
Therefore men fear Him; / He does not look upon any who are wise of heart.
