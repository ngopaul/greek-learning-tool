Then Elihu continued and said,
Do you consider this to be just? / Do you say, My righteousness is more than God's,
So that you say, What advantage is there to me, / What do I profit, more than if I had sinned?
I will respond to you with words, / And to your companions with you.
Look unto heaven and see; / And behold the skies: They are higher than you.
If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? / And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?
If you are righteous, what can you give to Him, / Or what does He receive from your hand?
Your wickedness affects a man like you, / And your righteousness, a son of man.
Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; / They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.
But no one says, Where is God my Maker, / Who gives songs in the night,
Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth / And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?
There they cry, but He does not answer, / Because of the pride of evil men.
Surely God does not hear an empty cry, / And the Almighty does not regard it.
How much less when you say that you do not behold Him, / That the cause is before Him and you are waiting on Him!
But now, because He has not visited in His anger / Nor regarded such great arrogance,
Job opens his mouth in vanity; / He multiplies words without knowledge.
