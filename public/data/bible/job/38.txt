Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,
Who is this who darkens counsel / By words without knowledge?
Gird up now your loins like a mighty man; / For I will ask of you, and you shall inform Me.
Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? / Tell Me, if you have understanding.
Who set its measurements--if you know? / Or who stretched the measuring line over it?
Onto what were its bases sunk, / Or who laid its cornerstone,
When the morning stars sang together / And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
And who hedged in the sea with doors / When it burst forth, issuing from the womb,
When I made clouds its clothing / And deep darkness its swaddling clothes,
And I broke out My boundaries for it / And set up bars and doors,
And I said, To here you shall come and no farther, / And here shall your proud waves be stopped?
Have you ever commanded the morning since your days began? / Have you ever caused the dawn to know its place,
So that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, / And the wicked might be shaken out of it?
The earth is changed like clay under a seal, / And all things on it stand forth like a garment.
And from the wicked their light is withheld, / And the high arm is broken.
Have you entered into the springs of the sea, / Or have you walked about in the recesses of the deep?
Have the gates of death been revealed to you, / Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Have you comprehended the full expanse of the earth? / Declare it, if you know it all.
Where is the way to the dwelling of the light? / And the darkness, where is its place,
That you may take it to its boundary, / And that you may perceive the paths to its house?
You know, for you were born then, / And the number of your days is great.
Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, / Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
Which I have reserved for the time of calamity, / For the day of battle and of war?
Where is the way to the place where the light is divided, / To the place where the east wind scatters upon the earth?
Who cut a channel for the rain torrent, / Or a way for the thunderbolt,
To make it rain on a land where no man is, / On a wilderness in which there is no man;
To satisfy the waste and desolate land / And to cause the shoots of grass to sprout?
Does the rain have a father? / Or who begot the drops of dew?
From whose womb does the ice come forth? / And the frost of heaven, who gave birth to it?
The waters hide themselves and become like stone, / And the surface of the deep is frozen.
Can you fasten the bands of the Pleiades, / Or loosen the cords of Orion?
Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? / Or can you guide the Bear with its cubs?
Do you know the laws of the heavens? / Do you establish their rule on the earth?
Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, / So that a flood of water would cover you?
Can you send forth lightnings, so that they would go / And say to you, Here we are?
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts, / Or given understanding to the mind?
Who can number the clouds by wisdom, / Or who can tip over the water jars of heaven,
When the dust runs into a mass / And the clods stick together?
Can you hunt prey for the lioness, / Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
When they crouch in their dens, / When they lie in wait in the thicket?
Who provides for the raven its prey / When its young ones cry out to God / And wander about for lack of food?
