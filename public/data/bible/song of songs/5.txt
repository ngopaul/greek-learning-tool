I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; / I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; / I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; / I have drunk my wine with my milk. / Eat, O friends; / Drink, and drink deeply, O beloved ones!
I sleep, but my heart is awake. / A sound! My beloved is knocking. / Open to me, my sister, my love, / My dove, my perfect one; / For my head is drenched with dew, / My locks with the drops of night.
I have put off my garment; / How can I put it on again? / I have washed my feet; / How can I dirty them again?
My beloved put his hand into the opening of the door, / And my inner parts yearned for him.
I rose up to open to my beloved; / And my hands dripped with myrrh, / My fingers with liquid myrrh, / Upon the handles of the bolt.
I opened to my beloved, / But my beloved had withdrawn; he was gone. / My soul failed when he spoke; / I sought him, but found him not; / I called him--he answered me not.
The watchmen who go about the city found me. / They struck me; they wounded me; / The keepers of the walls took my veil from me.
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / If you find my beloved, / What shall you tell him? / That I am sick with love.
What is your beloved more than some other's beloved, / O you most beautiful among women? / What is your beloved more than some other's beloved, / That you adjure us so?
My beloved is dazzling white yet ruddy, / Distinguished among ten thousand.
His head is the finest gold; / His locks are wavy, / As black as a raven.
His eyes are like doves / Beside the streams of water, / Bathed in milk, / Fitly set.
His cheeks are like a bed of spices, / Mounds of sweetly fragrant herbs; / His lips are lilies, / Dripping with liquid myrrh.
His hands are tubes of gold, / Set with beryl; / His belly is an ivory work, / Overlaid with sapphires.
His legs are pillars of white marble, / Set upon bases of gold; / His appearance is like Lebanon, / As excellent as the cedars.
His mouth is sweetness itself, / And he is altogether desirable. / This is my beloved, and this is my friend, / O daughters of Jerusalem.
