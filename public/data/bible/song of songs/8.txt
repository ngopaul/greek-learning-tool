Oh that you were like a brother to me, / Who nursed at my mother's breasts! / If I found you outside, I would kiss you, / And none would despise me.
I would lead you and bring you / Into my mother's house, / Who has instructed me; / I would make you drink spiced wine / From the juice of my pomegranate.
His left hand would be under my head, / And his right hand would embrace me.
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Do not rouse up or awaken my love / Until she pleases.
Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, / Leaning on her beloved? / I awakened you under the apple tree: / There your mother was in labor with you; / There she was in labor and brought you forth.
Set me as a seal on your heart, / As a seal on your arm; / For love is as strong as death, / Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; / Its flashes are the flashes of fire, / A flame of Jehovah.
Many waters cannot quench love, / Nor do floods drown it. / If a man gave all the substance of his house for love, / It would be utterly despised.
We have a little sister, / And she has no breasts: / What shall we do for our sister / On the day when she is spoken for?
If she is a wall, / We will build on her a battlement of silver; / And if she is a door, / We will enclose her with boards of cedar.
I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers; / Then I was in his eyes like one who has found peace.
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon: / He let out the vineyard to keepers; / Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me. / You will have the thousand, O Solomon; / And those who keep its fruit, two hundred.
O you who dwell in the gardens, / My companions listen for your voice; / Let me hear it.
Make haste, my beloved, / And be like a gazelle or a young hart / Upon the mountains of spices.
