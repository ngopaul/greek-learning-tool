Where has your beloved gone, / O you most beautiful among women? / Where has your beloved turned, / That we may seek him with you?
My beloved has gone down to his garden, / To the beds of spices, / To feed in the gardens / And gather lilies.
I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine; / He pastures his flock among the lilies.
You are as beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, / As lovely as Jerusalem, / As terrible as an army with banners.
Turn your eyes away from me, / For they overwhelm me. / Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Gilead.
Your teeth are like a flock of ewes / That have come up from the washing, / All of which have borne twins, / And none of them is bereaved of her young.
Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate / Behind your veil.
There are sixty queens and eighty concubines / And virgins without number.
My dove, my perfect one, is but one; / She is the only one of her mother; / She is the choice one of her who bore her. / The daughters saw her, and they called her blessed; / The queens and the concubines, / They also praised her.
Who is this woman who looks forth like the dawn, / As beautiful as the moon, / As clear as the sun, / As terrible as an army with banners?
I went down to the orchard of nuts / To see the freshness of the valley, / To see whether the vine had budded, / Whether the pomegranates were in bloom.
Before I was aware, / My soul set me among the chariots of my noble people.
Return, return, O Shulammite; / Return, return, that we may gaze at you. / Why should you gaze at the Shulammite, / As upon the dance of two camps?
