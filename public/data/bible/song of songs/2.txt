I am a rose of Sharon, / A lily of the valleys.
As a lily among thorns, / So is my love among the daughters.
As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
He brought me into the banqueting house, / And his banner over me was love.
Sustain me with raisin cakes, / Refresh me with apples, / For I am sick with love.
His left hand is under my head, / And his right hand embraces me.
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields, / Not to rouse up or awaken my love / Until she pleases.
The voice of my beloved! Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills.
My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. / Now he stands behind our wall; / He is looking through the windows, / He is glancing through the lattice.
My beloved responds and says to me, / Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come away;
For now the winter is past; / The rain is over and gone.
Flowers appear on the earth; / The time of singing has come, / And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
The fig tree has ripened its figs, / And the vines are in blossom--they give forth their fragrance. / Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come away.
My dove, in the clefts of the rock, / In the covert of the precipice, / Let me see your countenance, / Let me hear your voice; / For your voice is sweet, / And your countenance is lovely.
Catch the foxes for us, / The little foxes, / That ruin the vineyards / While our vineyards are in blossom.
My beloved is mine, and I am his; / He pastures his flock among the lilies.
Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away, / Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young hart / On the mountains of Bether.
