The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! / For your love is better than wine.
Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; / Your name is like ointment poured forth; / Therefore the virgins love you.
Draw me; we will run after you--The king has brought me into his chambers--/ We will be glad and rejoice in you; / We will extol your love more than wine. / Rightly do they love you.
I am black but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
Do not look at me, because I am black, / Because the sun has scorched me. / My mother's sons were angry with me; / They made me keeper of the vineyards, / But my own vineyard I have not kept.
Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock? / Where do you make it lie down at noon? / For why should I be like one who is veiled / Beside the flocks of your companions?
If you yourself do not know, / You fairest among women, / Go forth on the footsteps of the flock, / And pasture your young goats / By the shepherds' tents.
I compare you, my love, / To a mare among Pharaoh's chariots.
Your cheeks are lovely with plaits of ornaments, / Your neck with strings of jewels.
We will make you plaits of gold / With studs of silver.
While the king was at his table, / My spikenard gave forth its fragrance.
My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh / That lies at night between my breasts.
My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers / In the vineyards of En-gedi.
Oh, you are beautiful, my love! / Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes are like doves.
Oh, you are beautiful, my beloved; indeed, pleasant! Indeed, our couch is green.
The beams of our house are cedars; / Our rafters are cypresses.
