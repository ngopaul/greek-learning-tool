How beautiful are your footsteps in sandals, / O prince's daughter! / Your rounded thighs are like jewels, / The work of the hands of a skilled artist.
Your navel is a round goblet / That never lacks mixed wine; / Your belly is a heap of wheat, / Fenced in by lilies.
Your two breasts are like two fawns, / Twins of a gazelle.
Your neck is like a tower of ivory; / Your eyes, like the pools in Heshbon / By the gate of Bath-rabbim; / Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, / Which faces Damascus.
Your head upon you is like Carmel, / And the locks of your head like purple. / The king is fettered by your tresses.
How beautiful and how pleasant in delights / You are, O love!
This your stature is like a palm tree, / And your breasts are like the clusters.
I said, I will climb the palm tree; / I will take hold of its branches; / And let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, / And the fragrance of your nose like apples,
And the roof of your mouth like the best wine--Going down smoothly for my beloved, / Gliding through the lips of those who sleep.
I am my beloved's, / And his desire is for me.
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields; / Let us lodge in the villages.
Let us rise up early for the vineyards; / Let us see if the vine has budded, / If the blossom is open, / If the pomegranates are in bloom; / There I will give you my love.
The mandrakes give forth fragrance, / And over our doors are all choice fruits, / New as well as old. / These, my beloved, I have stored up for you.
