And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman).
And they said, Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not also spoken through us? And Jehovah heard it.
Now the man Moses was very meek, more than anyone else who was on the face of the earth.
And suddenly Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam, You three come out to the Tent of Meeting. So the three of them came out.
Then Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam. And when they had both come forward,
He said, Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, / I, Jehovah, will make Myself known to him in a vision; / I will speak with him in a dream.
My servant Moses is not so; / He is faithful in all My house.
With him I speak face to face, even openly, and not in riddles;And he beholds the form of Jehovah. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?
And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them, and He departed.
And when the cloud had departed from over the tent; there Miriam was, leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and there she was, leprous.
And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, please do not lay this sin upon us that we have so foolishly committed.
Please do not let her be like one dead, whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, Please heal her, O God, please.
And Jehovah said to Moses, If her father had just spat in her face, would she not bear her shame seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.
So Miriam was shut up outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out until Miriam had been brought in again.
After that the people set out from Hazeroth and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
