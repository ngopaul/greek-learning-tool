Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and take from them rods, one for each father's house, twelve rods from all their leaders according to their fathers' houses; you shall write everyone's name upon his rod.
And you shall write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of each of their fathers' houses.
And you shall place them in the Tent of Meeting before the Testimony, where I meet with you.
And the rod of the man whom I choose shall bud, and I will put a stop to the murmurings of the children of Israel against Me, which they murmur against you.
So Moses spoke to the children of Israel. And every one of their leaders gave him a rod, one rod for each leader according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods.
And Moses placed the rods before Jehovah in the Tent of the Testimony.
And on the next day Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony, and there was the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi: it had budded; it even put forth buds and produced blossoms and bore ripe almonds.
And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel, and they looked; and each one took his rod.
Then Jehovah said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the Testimony to be kept as a sign against the rebels, so that you may put an end to their murmurings against Me, and they not die.
And Moses did so; just as Jehovah commanded him, so he did.
And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Alas, we die out; we perish; all of us perish.
Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of Jehovah, dies. Are we to completely die out?
