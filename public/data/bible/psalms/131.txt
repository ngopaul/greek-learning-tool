O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, / Nor are my eyes haughty; / Nor do I go about in things too great / Or too wondrous for me.
Surely I have calmed / And quieted my soul, / Like a weaned child with its mother; / Like a weaned child is my soul within me.
Hope in Jehovah, O Israel, / From now and to eternity.
