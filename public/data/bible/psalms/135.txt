Hallelujah! Praise the name of Jehovah; / Praise Him, you servants of Jehovah,
Who stand in the house of Jehovah, / In the courts of the house of our God.
Praise Jehovah, for Jehovah is good; / Sing psalms to His name, for it is pleasant.
For Jehovah has chosen Jacob for Himself, / Israel for His personal treasure.
For I know that Jehovah is great / And that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatever Jehovah pleases He does / In heaven and on earth, / In the seas and all the depths.
He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; / He makes lightning for the rain; / He brings forth wind from His treasuries.
He struck the firstborn of Egypt, / Both of man and of beast.
He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, / Upon Pharaoh and all his servants.
He struck many nations / And slew mighty kings:
Sihon the king of the Amorites / And Og the king of Bashan / And all the kingdoms of Canaan.
And He gave their land as an inheritance, / An inheritance to Israel His people.
O Jehovah, Your name is forever; / O Jehovah, Your memorial is from generation to generation.
For Jehovah will execute judgment for His people, / And He will have compassion concerning His servants.
The idols of the nations are mere silver and gold, / The work of human hands.
They have mouths, but they do not speak; / They have eyes, but they do not see.
They have ears, but they do not give ear; / And there is no breath in their mouths.
Those who make them, / All who trust in them, / Will be like them.
O house of Israel, bless Jehovah. / O house of Aaron, bless Jehovah.
O house of Levi, bless Jehovah. / O you who fear Jehovah, bless Jehovah.
Blessed be Jehovah from Zion, / Who dwells in Jerusalem. / Hallelujah.
