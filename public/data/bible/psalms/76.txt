God is known in Judah; / His name is great in Israel.
And in Salem is His tabernacle, / And His dwelling place, in Zion.
There He broke the flashing arrows of the bow, / The shield and the sword and the battle. Selah
More glorious are You, / More excellent than the mountains of prey.
The stouthearted are despoiled; / They slept their sleep, / And none of the men of strength / Have found their hands.
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, / Both chariot and horse fall into deep sleep.
You, indeed You, are to be feared; / And who may stand before You once You are angry?
You caused judgment to be heard from the heavens; / The earth feared and was still,
When God rose for judgment, / To save all the meek of the earth. Selah
For the wrath of man will praise You; / You will gird Yourself with the remainder of wrath.
Make vows and pay them to Jehovah your God; / Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared.
He will cut off the spirit of the princes; / He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
