Jehovah is my light and my salvation; / Whom shall I fear? / Jehovah is the strength of my life; / Whom shall I dread?
When evildoers come near me / To devour my flesh, / It is they, my adversaries and my enemies, / Who stumble and fall.
If an army camps against me, / My heart does not fear; / If a battle arises against me, / In spite of this I am confident.
One thing I have asked from Jehovah; / That do I seek: / To dwell in the house of Jehovah / All the days of my life, / To behold the beauty of Jehovah, / And to inquire in His temple.
For He will conceal me in His shelter / In the day of trouble; / He will hide me in the hiding place of His tent; / He will raise me up upon a rock.
And now my head is lifted up / Above my enemies who surround me. / And I will offer in His tent / Sacrifices of shouts of joy: / I will sing and psalm to Jehovah.
Hear, O Jehovah, when I call with my voice, / And be gracious to me and answer me.
When You say, Seek My face, / To You my heart says, Your face, O Jehovah, will I seek.
Do not hide Your face from me; / Do not turn Your servant away in Your anger; / You have been my help. / Do not abandon me or forsake me, / O God of my salvation.
If my father and my mother forsake me, / Jehovah will take me up.
Teach me, O Jehovah, Your way, / And lead me on a level path / Because of those who lie in wait for me.
Do not give me over / To the will of my adversaries; / For false witnesses have risen up against me, / And those who breathe out threats.
I have believed / That I would see the goodness of Jehovah / In the land of the living.
Wait for Jehovah; / Be strong, and let your heart be encouraged. / Yes, wait for Jehovah.
