Transgression speaks to the wicked / Within his heart; / There is no dread of God / Before his eyes.
For he flatters himself in his own eyes, / That his iniquity cannot be found out and hated.
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; / He has ceased being wise and doing good.
He plans wickedness on his bed; / He sets himself on a way that is not good; / He does not reject evil.
O Jehovah, Your lovingkindness is in the heavens; / Your faithfulness reaches unto the skies.
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; / Your judgments are like the great deep; / You preserve man and beast, O Jehovah.
How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God! / Thus the sons of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures.
For with You is the fountain of life; / In Your light we see light.
Continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You, / And Your righteousness to those who are upright in heart.
Do not let the foot of the arrogant come upon me, / Nor let the hand of the wicked drive me away.
There the workers of iniquity are fallen; / They are cast down and unable to rise.
