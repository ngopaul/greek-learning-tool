I love Jehovah because He hears / My voice, my supplications,
Because He inclines His ear to me; / Therefore I will call upon Him all my days.
The bonds of death encompassed me, / And the distresses of Sheol fell upon me; / I fell upon trouble and sorrow.
But I called upon the name of Jehovah. / O Jehovah, I pray, deliver my soul.
Jehovah is gracious and righteous, / Indeed our God is compassionate.
Jehovah preserves the simple: / I was brought low, and He saved me.
Return to your rest, O my soul; / For Jehovah has dealt bountifully with you.
For You have delivered my soul from death, / My eyes from tears, / My feet from stumbling.
I will walk before Jehovah / In the land of the living.
I believed, therefore I spoke; / I was afflicted greatly.
I said in my haste, / All men are liars.
What shall I return to Jehovah / For all His benefits toward me?
I will take up the cup of salvation / And call upon the name of Jehovah.
I will pay my vows to Jehovah, / Oh, in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the sight of Jehovah / Is the death of His faithful ones.
O Jehovah! / Surely I am Your servant; / I am Your servant, the son of Your female servant; / You have loosed my bonds.
To You I will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving, / And I will call upon the name of Jehovah.
I will pay my vows to Jehovah, / Oh, in the presence of all His people,
In the courts of the house of Jehovah, / In the midst of you, O Jerusalem. / Hallelujah.
