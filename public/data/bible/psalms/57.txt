Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me; / For my soul takes refuge in You; / Indeed in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge, / Until the destruction passes by.
I call out to God the Most High, / To the God who accomplishes all things for me.
He sends forth from heaven and saves me; / He reproaches him who would trample me; Selah / God sends forth / His lovingkindness and His faithfulness.
My soul is among lions; / I lie down among those who blaze forth, the sons of men, / Whose teeth are spears and arrows, / And whose tongue is a sharp sword.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; / Let Your glory be above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; / My soul is bowed down. / They have dug a pit before me; / They have fallen into it themselves. Selah
My heart is steadfast, O God; / My heart is steadfast. / I will sing, indeed I will sing psalms.
Awake, my glory; / Awake, O harp and lyre! / I will awaken the dawn.
I will give thanks to You among the peoples, O Lord; / I will sing psalms to You among the nations.
For Your lovingkindness is as great as the heavens; / And Your faithfulness reaches unto the skies.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; / Let Your glory be above all the earth.
