O Shepherd of Israel, give ear, / You who lead Joseph like a flock; / You who are enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh / Stir up Your might, / And come to save us.
O God, restore us; / And cause Your face to shine, and we will be saved.
O Jehovah God of hosts, / How long will You fume / Against the prayer of Your people?
You have fed them with the bread of tears / And have made them drink tears in large measure.
You have made us a cause of strife to our neighbors, / And our enemies deride us among themselves.
O God of hosts, restore us; / And cause Your face to shine, and we will be saved.
You brought a vine out of Egypt; / You drove out nations and planted it;
You cleared the ground before it, / And it took deep root and filled the land.
The mountains were covered with its shadow, / And its boughs were like the cedars of God.
It put forth its branches unto the sea, / And its shoots unto the River.
Why have You broken down its hedges, / So that all who pass by on the way pluck it?
The boar from the forest ravages it, / And that which moves through the field feeds on it.
O God of hosts, turn, we beseech You; / Look down from heaven and see, / And visit this vine,
Even the stock which Your right hand has planted / And the son whom You have strengthened for Yourself.
It is burned with fire; it is cut down; / They perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.
Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, / Upon the son of man whom You have strengthened for Yourself;
Then we will not turn back from You. / Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.
O Jehovah God of hosts, restore us; / Cause Your face to shine, and we will be saved.
