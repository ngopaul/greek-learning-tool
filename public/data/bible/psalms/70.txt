O God, hasten to deliver me; / O Jehovah, hasten to help me.
May those who seek my life / Be put to shame and confounded; / May those who take delight in my misfortune / Be turned back and humiliated;
May those who say, Aha! Aha! / Turn away because of their shame;
May all those who seek You / Be glad and rejoice in You; / And may those who love Your salvation / Say continually, / May God be magnified!
But I am poor and needy; / O God, hasten to me. / You are my help and my Deliverer; / O Jehovah, do not delay.
