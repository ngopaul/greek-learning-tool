He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High / Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
I say of Jehovah, / My refuge and My fortress, / My God in whom I trust!
For He will deliver You / From the snare of the fowler, / From the deadly pestilence.
With His pinions He will cover You, / And under His wings You will take refuge; / His truth is a shield and a buckler.
You will not be afraid of the terror by night, / Or of the arrow that flies by day,
Or of the pestilence that walks in darkness, / Or of the destruction that lays waste at noon.
A thousand will fall at Your side, / And ten thousand at Your right hand; / But it will not come near to You.
You will only look on with Your eyes / And see the recompense of the wicked.
For You have made Jehovah, who is my refuge, / Even the Most High, Your habitation;
No evil will befall You, / Nor will any plague come near Your tent.
For He will give His angels charge concerning You / To keep You in all Your ways.
They will bear You up in their hands, / Lest You dash Your foot against a stone.
You will tread upon the lion and the cobra; / You will trample the young lion and the serpent.
Because He has set His love upon Me, I will rescue Him; / I will set Him on high, because He has known My name.
He will call upon Me, and I will answer Him. / I will be with Him in distress; / I will deliver Him and honor Him.
With an extension of His days I will satisfy Him, / And I will show Him My salvation.
