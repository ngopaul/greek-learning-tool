Why are the nations in an uproar, / And why do the peoples contemplate a vain thing?
The kings of the earth take their stand, / And the rulers sit in counsel together, / Against Jehovah and against His Anointed:
Let us break apart Their bonds / And cast Their ropes away from us.
He who sits in the heavens laughs; / The Lord has them in derision.
Then He will speak to them in His anger, / And in His burning wrath He will terrify them:
But I have installed My King / Upon Zion, My holy mountain.
I will recount the decree of Jehovah; / He said to Me: You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You.
Ask of Me, / And I will give the nations as Your inheritance / And the limits of the earth as Your possession.
You will break them with an iron rod; / You will shatter them like a potter's vessel.
Now therefore, O kings, be prudent; / Take the admonition, O judges of the earth.
Serve Jehovah with fear, / And rejoice with trembling.
Kiss the Son / Lest He be angry and you perish from the way; / For His anger may suddenly be kindled. / Blessed are all those who take refuge in Him.
