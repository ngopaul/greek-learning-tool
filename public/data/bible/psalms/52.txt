Why do you boast in evil, O mighty one? / God's lovingkindness endures continually.
Your tongue devises destruction; / It is like a sharpened razor, O worker of deceit.
You have loved evil rather than good, / Falsehood rather than speaking righteousness. Selah
You have loved all the devouring words, / O deceitful tongue.
God will likewise break you down forever; / He will take you and pluck you up from your tent, / And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
And the righteous will see it and fear, / And they will laugh at him, saying,
Behold, this is that mighty man / Who did not make God his strength, / But trusted in the multitude of his riches / And strengthened himself in his desire.
But I, like a flourishing olive tree / In the house of God, / Trust in God's lovingkindness / Forever and ever.
I will give You thanks forever, / For You have acted; / And I will hope in Your name in the presence of Your faithful ones, / For it is good.
