Many times have they afflicted me since my youth, / Let Israel say,
Many times have they afflicted me since my youth, / Yet they did not prevail against me.
The plowers plowed on my back; / They made their furrows long.
Jehovah is righteous; / He has cut the cords of the wicked.
May all who hate Zion / Be put to shame and turned back.
May they be like grass on the housetops, / Which withers before it grows up,
With which the reaper does not fill his hand, / Or he who binds sheaves, his bosom.
Nor may those who pass by say, / The blessing of Jehovah be upon you! / We bless you in the name of Jehovah.
