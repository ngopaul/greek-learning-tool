Do you indeed, O judges, speak righteousness? / Do you judge in uprightness, O sons of men?
No, in heart you perform injustice; / You weigh out the violence of your hands on earth.
The wicked are estranged from the womb; / They err from their birth, speaking lies.
Their venom is like the venom of a serpent; / They are like the deaf cobra that has shut its ear,
Which does not hear the sound of the charmers / Or the wise spellbinder.
O God, break their teeth in their mouth; / Break off the fangs of the young lions, O Jehovah.
Let them melt like water that runs off. / When he shoots his arrows, / Let them be as though they were cut off.
Let them be like a snail that melts and goes away, / Like a woman's miscarriage, which by no means sees the sun.
Before your pots can feel the fire of the thorns, / Whether green or burning, He will sweep them away.
The righteous man will rejoice when he sees vengeance; / He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
And men will say, Indeed there is fruit for the righteous man; / Indeed there is a God who judges on earth.
