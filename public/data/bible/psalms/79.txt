O God, the nations have come into Your inheritance; / They have defiled Your holy temple; / They have turned Jerusalem into heaps.
They have given the dead bodies of Your servants / As food for the birds of heaven, / The flesh of Your saints to the animals of the earth.
They have poured out their blood like water around Jerusalem, / And there was no one to bury them.
We have become a reproach to our neighbors, / A mocking and a derision to those around us.
How long, O Jehovah? Will You be angry forever? / Will Your jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out Your wrath upon the nations / Who do not know You, / And upon the kingdoms / Who do not call upon Your name.
For they have devoured Jacob / And have desolated his habitation.
Do not remember against us the iniquities of our forefathers; / May Your compassions quickly meet us, / For we have been brought very low.
Help us, O God of our salvation, / For the glory of Your name; / And deliver us and expiate our sins, / For Your name's sake.
Why should the nations say, / Where is their God? / May the avenging of the blood of Your servants, which has been poured out, / Be known among the nations in our sight.
May the sighing of the prisoner come before You. / According to the greatness of Your power preserve those appointed to die,
And render to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom / Their reproach, with which they have reproached You, O Lord.
And we, Your people and the sheep of Your pasture, / Will give You thanks forever; / From generation to generation we will tell out Your praise.
