O God, we have heard with our ears; / Our fathers have recounted it to us, / The work You did in their days, / In the days of old.
You, by Your hand, / Have dispossessed nations, but You have planted our fathers; / You afflicted peoples, but You spread our fathers forth.
For they did not possess the land by their sword, / Nor did their arm save them; / Rather it was Your right hand and Your arm, / And the light of Your countenance; / For You delighted in them.
You are my King, O God; / Command salvation for Jacob.
Through You we thrust back our adversaries; / Through Your name we trample those who rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow, / Nor will my sword save me.
But You save us from our adversaries, / And You put to shame those who hate us.
In God we boast all day long, / And we praise Your name forever. Selah
Nevertheless You have rejected us and humiliated us, / And You have not gone forth with our armies.
You have caused us to turn back from the adversary, / And those who hate us take spoil for themselves.
You have given us over like sheep to be eaten / And have scattered us among the nations.
You have sold Your people for nothing / And have not gone high on their price.
You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, / A mocking and a derision to those around us.
You have made us a proverb among the nations, / Something to shake the head at among the peoples.
All day long my humiliation is before me, / And the shame of my face covers me,
Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles, / Because of the presence of the enemy and of him who avenges himself.
All this has come upon us; but we have not forgotten You, / Nor have we been false to Your covenant.
Our heart has not turned back, / Nor have our steps deviated from Your way;
But You have crushed us in the place of jackals / And have covered us with the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the name of our God / Or spread out our hands to a strange god,
Will God not search this out? / For He knows the hidden things of the heart.
But for Your sake we are slain all day long; / We are considered as sheep for slaughter.
Awake! Why are You sleeping, O Lord? / Arise! Do not reject us forever.
Why do You hide Your face / And forget our affliction and our oppression?
For our soul bows down to the dust; / Our body clings to the earth.
Rise up; be our help, / And redeem us for Your lovingkindness' sake.
