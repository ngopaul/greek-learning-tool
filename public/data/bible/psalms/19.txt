The heavens declare the glory of God, / And the expanse proclaims the work of His hands.
Day to day pours forth speech, / And night to night tells out knowledge.
There is no speech and there are no words; / Their voice is not heard.
In all the earth their line has gone forth, / And their words to the end of the world. / In the heavens He has made a tent for the sun,
And he, like a bridegroom, goes forth from his canopy; / He rejoices like a mighty man running the course.
His going forth is from the end of the heavens, / And his circuit is unto their ends; / And there is nothing hidden from his heat.
The law of Jehovah is perfect, / Restoring the soul; / The testimony of Jehovah is faithful, / Making the simple wise;
The precepts of Jehovah are right, / Making the heart joyous; / The commandment of Jehovah is clear, / Enlightening the eyes;
The fear of Jehovah is pure, / Enduring forever; / The judgments of Jehovah are truth / And altogether righteous.
More to be desired are they than gold, / Even much refined gold; / Sweeter also than honey / And the drippings of the honeycomb.
Moreover by them Your servant is warned; / In keeping them there is much reward.
Who can discern his errors? / Clear me of my secret faults.
Also keep back Your servant from presumptuous sins; / Do not let them have dominion over me; / Then I will be blameless and cleared / Of great transgression.
May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart / Be acceptable before You, / O Jehovah, my rock and my Redeemer.
