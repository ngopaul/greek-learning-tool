Surely God is good to Israel, / To those who are pure in heart.
But as for me, my feet were nearly turned aside; / My steps had almost slipped.
For I was envious of the arrogant, / When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
For they have no pangs in their death, / And their body is well nourished.
They do not find themselves in the hardship of men, / Nor are they plagued like other men.
Therefore pride is a necklace for them; / Violence covers them like a garment.
Their eyes bulge out from fatness; / The imaginations of their heart overflow.
They mock and wickedly speak of oppression; / They speak loftily.
They set their mouth against the heavens, / And their tongue walks about on the earth.
Therefore His people return here, / And waters of abundance are drained by them;
And they say, How does God know? / And is there knowledge with the Most High?
Behold, these are the wicked; / And always at ease, they heap up riches.
Surely I have purified my heart in vain, / And I have washed my hands in innocence.
For I have been plagued all day long / And chastened every morning.
If I had said, I will speak thus; / Behold, I would have betrayed the generation of Your children.
When I considered this in order to understand it, / It was a troublesome task in my sight,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God; / Then I perceived their end.
Surely You set them in slippery places; / You cast them down into ruins.
How they are made desolate in a moment! / They are utterly consumed by terrors.
Like a dream, when one awakes, You, O Lord, / Upon arising, will despise their image.
When my heart was embittered, / And inwardly I was pricked;
I was brutish and knew nothing; / I was like a beast before You.
Nevertheless I am continually with You; / You have taken hold of my right hand.
You will guide me with Your counsel, / And afterward You will receive me in glory.
Whom do I have in heaven but You? / And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth.
My flesh and my heart fail, / But God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever.
For behold, those who are far from You will perish; / You destroy all who go about as harlots away from You.
But as for me, drawing near to God is good for me; / I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, / That I may declare all Your works.
