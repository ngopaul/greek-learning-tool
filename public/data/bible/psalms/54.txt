O God, save me by Your name, / And execute judgment for me by Your might.
O God, hear my prayer; / Give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers have risen up against me, / And those who terrorize seek my life; / They do not set God before them. Selah
Behold, God is my Helper; / The Lord is among those who sustain my soul.
He will return the evil to those who lie in wait for me. / Annihilate them in Your faithfulness.
I will offer a freewill offering to You; / I will praise Your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.
For He has delivered me from all distress, / And my eye looks triumphantly upon my enemies.
