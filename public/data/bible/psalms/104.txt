Bless Jehovah, O my soul. / O Jehovah my God, You are very great. / You are clothed with majesty and splendor,
Wrapped with light as with a garment; / You stretch out the heavens like a tent curtain.
He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters; / He makes the clouds His chariot; / He walks upon the wings of the wind.
He makes winds His messengers, / Flames of fire His ministers.
He established the earth upon its foundations, / So that it cannot be moved forever and ever.
You covered it with the deep as with a garment; / The waters stood above the mountains.
At Your rebuke they fled; / At the voice of Your thunder they rushed away--
The mountains rose, the valleys sank--/ To the place that You established for them.
You set a border that they may not pass over, / That they may not turn back to cover the earth.
He makes the springs gush forth in the valleys; / They run among the mountains;
They give drink to every beast of the field; / The wild asses quench their thirst.
The birds of heaven dwell alongside them; / They utter their voice among the branches.
He waters the mountains from His upper chambers. / The earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.
He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, / And herbage for man's use, / That he may bring forth food from the earth:
Even wine that cheers man's heart, / Oil that makes his face shine, / And bread that sustains man's heart.
The trees of Jehovah are full of sap, / The cedars of Lebanon, which He planted,
Where the birds build their nests; / As for the stork, the cypresses are her house.
The high mountains are for the wild goats; / The cliffs are a refuge to the rock badgers.
He made the moon to mark seasons; / The sun knows the time of its going down.
You make darkness, and it is night, / In which all the beasts of the forest creep about.
The young lions roar after their prey, / Even to seek their food from God.
The sun rises: they retreat / And lie down in their dens.
Man goes forth to his work / And to his labor until evening.
How many are Your works, O Jehovah! / In wisdom You have made all of them; / The earth is full of Your creatures.
Yonder is the sea, great and extensively wide; / There the creeping things are, even without number, / The small animals with the great.
There the ships go; / Leviathan is there, whom You have formed / To play in it.
They all wait for You, / That You may give them food at the proper time.
You give to them; they gather. / You open Your hand; they are satisfied with good.
You hide Your face; they are troubled. / You take away their breath; they perish, / And return to their dust.
You send forth Your Spirit; they are created, / And You renew the surface of the ground.
May the glory of Jehovah endure forever! / May Jehovah rejoice in His works,
He who looks on the earth, and it trembles; / He who touches the mountains, and they smoke!
I will sing to Jehovah while I live; / I will sing psalms to my God while I yet have being.
May my musing be sweet to Him; / I will rejoice in Jehovah.
May the sinners be consumed from off the earth, / And may the wicked be no more. / Bless Jehovah, O my soul. / Hallelujah.
