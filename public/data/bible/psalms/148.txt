Hallelujah! / Praise Jehovah from the heavens; / Praise Him in the heights.
Praise Him, all His angels; / Praise Him, all His hosts.
Praise Him, sun and moon; / Praise Him, all stars of light.
Praise Him, you heaven of heavens, / And you waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of Jehovah; / For He commanded, and they were created.
And He established them forever and ever; / He gave the decree which shall not pass away.
Praise Jehovah from the earth, / You sea monsters and all the depths;
Fire and hail, snow and smoke; / Stormy wind that executes His word;
Mountains and all hills; / Fruit trees and all cedars;
All animals wild and tame; / Creeping things and birds of flight;
Kings of the earth and all peoples; / Princes and all judges of the earth;
Choice young men as well as virgins; / Old men with young men.
Let them praise the name of Jehovah, / For His name alone is exalted; / His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
And He has raised up a horn for His people, / The praise of all His faithful ones, / The children of Israel, a people near to Him. / Hallelujah!
