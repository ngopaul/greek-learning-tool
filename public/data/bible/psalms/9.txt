I will give thanks to You, O Jehovah, with all my heart; / I will tell out all Your wonders.
I will rejoice and exult in You; / I will sing psalms to Your name, O Most High.
When my enemies turn back, / They stumble and perish at Your presence.
For You have upheld my right and my cause; / You sit on the throne, judging righteously.
You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; / You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
The enemies are finished; they are in perpetual ruins; / And You have uprooted their cities; the very memory of them has perished.
But Jehovah sits enthroned forever; / He has established His throne for judgment.
And it is He who judges the world with righteousness; / He executes judgment on the peoples with equity.
And Jehovah is a high retreat for the oppressed, / A high retreat in times of distress.
And those who know Your name put their trust in You, / For You have not forsaken those who seek You, O Jehovah.
Sing psalms to Jehovah, the Inhabitant of Zion; / Declare His deeds among the peoples,
For He who avenges bloodshed remembers those who were slain; / He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
Be gracious to me, O Jehovah; look on my affliction from those who hate me, / You who raise me from the gates of death,
That I may tell out all Your praises / And, in the gates of the daughter of Zion, exult in Your salvation.
The nations have sunk in the pit that they have made; / In the net that they hid, their own foot is caught.
Jehovah has made Himself known; He has executed justice; / The wicked have been snared in the work of their hands. Higgaion. Selah
The wicked will be turned back to Sheol, / All the nations who forget God.
For not always will the needy be forgotten, / Nor will the hope of the afflicted perish forever.
Arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prevail; / Let the nations be judged in Your sight.
Put them in fear, O Jehovah; / Let the nations know that they are mortal men. Selah
