I will sing of lovingkindness and justice; / To You, O Jehovah, I will sing psalms.
I will give careful heed to the perfect way. / When will You come to me? / I will walk in the perfectness of my heart / Within my house.
I will not set anything base / Before my eyes; / I hate what those who turn aside do; / It will not cling to me.
A perverse heart will depart from me; / No evil will I know.
He who secretly slanders his neighbor, / Him I will destroy; / He who is of a haughty look and a proud heart, / Him I will not tolerate.
My eyes are on the faithful of the land, / That they may abide with me; / He who walks in the perfect way, / He will minister to me.
He who practices deceit / Will not dwell within my house; / He who speaks lies will not be maintained / In my sight.
Morning by morning I will destroy / All the wicked of the land, / In order to cut off from the city of Jehovah / All the workers of iniquity.
