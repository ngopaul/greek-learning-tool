When Israel went forth from Egypt, / The house of Jacob from among a people of unintelligible speech,
Judah became His sanctuary, / Israel, His dominion.
The sea saw and fled; / The Jordan turned back.
The mountains skipped like rams, / The hills, like lambs.
What troubles you, O sea, that you flee? / O Jordan, that you turn back?
O mountains, that you skip like rams? / O hills, like lambs?
Tremble at the presence of the Lord, O earth, / At the presence of the God of Jacob,
Who turns the rock into a pool of water, / The flint into a fountain of water.
