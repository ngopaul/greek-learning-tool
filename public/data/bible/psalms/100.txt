Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all the earth.
Serve Jehovah with rejoicing; / Come before His presence with joyful singing.
Know that it is Jehovah who is God; / It is He who has made us and not we ourselves. / We are His people and the sheep of His pasture.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving, / His courts with praise; / Give thanks to Him; bless His name.
For Jehovah is good; His lovingkindness is forever, / And His faithfulness is to all generations.
