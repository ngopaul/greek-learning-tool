Blessed is he who considers the poor; / In the day of evil Jehovah will deliver him.
May Jehovah keep him and preserve him alive; / May he be blessed in the land; / And do not give him over to the will of his enemies.
Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed; / You make all his bed in his illness.
I said, O Jehovah, be gracious to me; / Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.
My enemies speak evil against me: / When will he die and his name perish?
And if he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood. / His heart gathers iniquity to itself; / When he goes out, he speaks it.
All who hate me whisper together against me; / Against me they devise my misfortune.
Some evil illness, they say, has been poured out on him; / And when he lies down, he will not rise again.
Even my familiar friend, in whom I trusted, / Who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.
But You, O Jehovah, be gracious to me and raise me up / That I may recompense them.
By this I know that You delight in me, / That my enemy has not shouted in triumph over me.
And as for me, You uphold me in my integrity, / And You set me in Your presence forever.
Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, / From eternity to eternity. / Amen and Amen.
