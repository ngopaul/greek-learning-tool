Hallelujah! / Praise God in His sanctuary; / Praise Him in the expanse that manifests His power.
Praise Him for His mighty acts; / Praise Him according to His vast greatness.
Praise Him with the blast of the trumpet; / Praise Him with the harp and lyre;
Praise Him with the tambourine and with dancing; / Praise Him with the stringed instrument and the pipe.
Praise Him with the loud cymbals; / Praise Him with the loud clanging cymbals.
Let everything that has breath praise Jehovah. / Hallelujah!
