Sing to Jehovah a new song, / For He has done wonderful things. / His right hand and His holy arm / Have accomplished salvation for Him.
Jehovah has made His salvation known; / In the sight of the nations / He has revealed His righteousness.
He remembered His lovingkindness and His faithfulness / Toward the house of Israel; / All the ends of the earth have seen / The salvation of our God.
Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all the earth; / Break forth, and sing for joy, and sing psalms.
Sing psalms to Jehovah with the lyre, / With the lyre and the sound of melody.
With trumpets and the sound of the horn / Make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah.
Let the sea and its fullness roar, / The world and those who inhabit it.
Let the rivers clap their hands; / Let the mountains sing for joy together
Before Jehovah, for He is coming / To judge the earth. / He will judge the world with righteousness / And the peoples with equity.
