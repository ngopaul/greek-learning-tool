My heart is fixed, O God; / I will sing, indeed I will sing psalms, / Even with my glory.
Awake, O harp and lyre! / I will awaken the dawn.
I will give thanks to You among the peoples, O Jehovah; / And I will sing psalms to You among the nations.
For Your lovingkindness is higher than the heavens, / And Your faithfulness reaches to the sky.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; / And let Your glory be above all the earth.
That Your beloved ones may be delivered, / Save with Your right hand, and answer us.
God has spoken in His holiness: I will exult; / I will divide Shechem / And measure out the Valley of Succoth.
Gilead is Mine; Manasseh is Mine; / And Ephraim is the helmet for My head; / Judah is My scepter.
Moab is My washbowl; / Upon Edom I will cast My sandal; / Over Philistia I will shout.
Who will bring me into the fortified city? / Who will lead me to Edom?
Will not You, O God, who rejected us / And who did not go forth, O God, with our armies?
Give us help from the adversary, / For a salvation by man is vain.
In God we will do valiantly, / And it is He who will tread down our adversaries.
