My soul waits in silence for God alone; / My salvation is from Him.
He alone is my rock and my salvation, / My high retreat; I will not be greatly shaken.
How long will you assail a man / So that you may slay him, all of you, / Like a leaning wall or a tottering fence?
They only make plans to thrust him down from his dignity; / They take delight in lies; / With their mouth they bless, / But inwardly they curse. Selah
My soul, wait in silence for God alone, / For my expectation is from Him.
He alone is my rock and my salvation, / My high retreat; I will not be shaken.
On God my salvation and my glory depend; / The rock of my strength, my refuge, is in God.
Trust in Him at all times, O people; / Pour out your heart before Him; / God is a refuge to us. Selah
Men of low degree are but a vapor; / Men of high degree, a lie. / In the balances they go up; / Together they are less than a vapor.
Do not trust in oppression, / And do not vainly hope in robbery; / If wealth increases, / Do not set your heart on it.
Once has God spoken; / Twice have I heard this, / That strength belongs to God.
To You also, O Lord, belongs lovingkindness; / For You repay every man according to his work.
