Render judgment for me, O God; / And plead my cause / Before an unfaithful nation; / From the deceitful and unjust man / Deliver me.
For You are the God of my protection. / Why have You rejected me? / Why do I go about mourning / Because of the oppression of the enemy?
Send forth Your light and Your truth; / They will lead me; / They will bring me to Your holy mountain / And to Your tabernacles.
And I will go to the altar of God, / To God my exceeding joy; / And I will praise You with the harp, / O God, my God.
Why are you cast down, O my soul? / And why are you disquieted within me? / Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, / The salvation of my countenance and my God.
