Clap your hands, all you peoples; / Shout to God with the voice of a triumphant sound.
For Jehovah Most High is awesome: / A great King over all the earth.
He subdues peoples under us, / And nations under our feet.
He chose our inheritance for us, / The excellency of Jacob, whom He loved. Selah
God ascends amidst shouting; / Jehovah, at the sound of a trumpet.
Sing psalms to God, sing psalms; / Sing psalms to our King, sing psalms.
For God is the King of all the earth; / Sing psalms with understanding.
God reigns over the nations; / God sits upon His holy throne.
The princes of the peoples have been gathered / As the people of the God of Abraham; / For the shields of the earth belong to God; / He is greatly exalted.
