Why, O God, have You cast us off forever? / Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?
Remember Your assembly, which You have purchased of old, / Which You have redeemed as the tribe of Your inheritance, / And Mount Zion, where You dwell.
Lift up Your steps unto the perpetual ruins; / The enemy has damaged everything in the sanctuary.
Your adversaries have roared in the midst of Your assembly place; / They have set up their symbols as signs.
It looked like when men bring up axes / On the thicket of the trees.
And now they have struck down with hatchet and hammer / Its carved work altogether.
They have set fire to Your sanctuary; / They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name to the ground.
They said in their heart, Let us oppress them completely. / They have burned down all God's assembly places in the land.
We do not see our signs; there is no longer a prophet, / Nor is there anyone among us who knows how long.
How long, O God, will the adversary reproach? / Will the enemy despise Your name forever?
Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? / Bring it forth from the midst of Your bosom; destroy them.
But God is my King of old, / Accomplishing salvation in the midst of the earth.
You divided the sea by Your strength; / You broke the heads of the sea serpents on the waters.
You crushed the heads of the leviathan; / You gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.
You broke open the fountain and the torrent; / You dried up the ever-flowing streams.
The day is Yours; the night also is Yours; / You prepared the moon and the sun.
You established all the borders of the earth: / You formed the summer and the winter.
Remember this: The enemy has reproached Jehovah, / And a foolish people has despised Your name.
Do not give the soul of Your turtledove to the wild beast; / Do not forget the life of Your poor forever.
Regard the covenant, / For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
Do not let him who is oppressed return ashamed. / May the poor and needy praise Your name.
Arise, O God; contend for Your own cause; / Remember how the foolish man reproaches You all day long.
Do not forget the voice of Your adversaries; / The roar of those who rise up against You goes up continually.
