I rejoiced when they said to me, / Let us go to the house of Jehovah.
Our feet are standing / Within your gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem has been built as a city / That has been compacted together;
To which the tribes go up, / The tribes of Jehovah--/ A testimony for Israel--/ To give thanks to the name of Jehovah.
For there thrones are set for judgment, / Thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. / Those who love you will prosper.
Peace be within your bulwarks, / And prosperity within your citadels.
For my brothers' and companions' sake I will now say, / Peace be within you.
For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God / I will seek your good.
