I extol You, O Jehovah, for You have drawn me up / And have not let my enemies rejoice over me.
O Jehovah my God, / I cried out to You, / And You healed me.
O Jehovah, You have brought up my soul from Sheol; / You have preserved me alive that I would not go down into the pit.
Sing psalms to Jehovah, you who are His faithful ones; / And praise His holy memorial.
For His anger lasts but a moment, / His favor, a lifetime; / Weeping may linger in the evening, / But a ringing shout goes up in the morning.
As for me, I said in my prosperity, / I will never be shaken.
O Jehovah, by Your favor You had made my mountain stand strong. / You hid Your face; I was troubled.
To You, O Jehovah, I called out; / And to Jehovah I made my supplication.
What profit is there in my blood if I go down into the pit? / Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness?
Hear, O Jehovah, and be gracious to me. / O Jehovah, be my help.
You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; / You have loosened my sackcloth / And girded me with rejoicing,
That my glory might sing psalms to You and not be silent. / O Jehovah my God, I will praise You forever.
