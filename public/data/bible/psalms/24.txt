The earth is Jehovah's, and its fullness, / The habitable land and those who dwell in it.
For it is He who founded it upon the seas / And established it upon the streams.
Who may ascend the mountain of Jehovah, / And who may stand in His holy place?
He who has clean hands and a pure heart, / Who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood / Or sworn deceitfully.
He will receive blessing from Jehovah, / And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
This is the generation of those who seek Him, / Those who seek Your face, even Jacob. Selah
Lift up your heads, O gates; / And be lifted up, O long enduring doors; / And the King of glory will come in.
Who is the King of glory? / Jehovah strong and mighty! / Jehovah mighty in battle!
Lift up your heads, O gates; / And lift up, O long enduring doors; / And the King of glory will come in.
Who is this King of glory? / Jehovah of hosts--/ He is the King of glory! Selah
