O Jehovah my God, in You do I take refuge. / Save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me;
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, / Tearing it apart without anyone to deliver it.
O Jehovah my God, if I have done this, / If there is unrighteousness in my hands,
If I have recompensed with evil him who was at peace with me / (Rather, I have delivered him who vexed me without cause);
Let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake me, / And let him trample my life to the ground / And lay my glory down in the dust. Selah
Arise, O Jehovah, in Your anger; / Lift Yourself up against the overflowing wrath of those who vex me, / And awake for me: You have commanded judgment.
And let the assembly of the peoples surround You, / And over it return on high.
Jehovah will execute judgment on the peoples; / Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness / And according to my integrity that is with me.
Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, / But establish the righteous man. / For the righteous God / Tries the hearts and the inward parts.
My shield is with God, / Who saves the upright in heart.
God is a righteous Judge / And a God who has indignation every day.
If one does not turn, He will whet His sword. / He bends His bow and makes it ready.
And He prepares instruments of death against him; / He has made His arrows fiery shafts.
Behold, the evil man travails with iniquity; / He conceives mischief and brings forth falsehood.
He digs a pit and hollows it out, / Then he falls into the hole that he has made.
His mischief returns upon his own head, / And upon the crown of his own head his violence comes down.
I will give thanks to Jehovah according to His righteousness, / And I will sing psalms to the name of Jehovah the Most High.
