Be gracious to me, O God; for man tramples me; / All day long he, fighting, oppresses me.
Those who lie in wait for me trample me all day long, / For many are those who arrogantly fight against me.
When I am afraid, / I trust in You.
In God, whose word I praise, / In God do I trust, and I will not be afraid. / What can flesh do to me?
All day long they wrest my words; / All their thoughts are against me for evil.
They gather themselves; they lurk; / They watch my steps, / As they have waited to take my life.
Will there be deliverance for them in spite of their iniquity? / In anger cast down the peoples, O God.
You have counted my wanderings. / Put my tears into Your bottle. / Are they not in Your book?
Then my enemies will turn back / When I call; / This I know, / That God is for me.
In God, whose word I praise, / In Jehovah, whose word I praise,
In God do I trust; I will not be afraid. / What can man do to me?
Your vows, O God, are on me; / I will render thank offerings to You.
For You have delivered my soul from death, / Indeed, my feet from stumbling, / That I may walk before God / In the light of the living.
