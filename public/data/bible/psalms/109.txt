O God of my praise, do not be silent;
For the mouth of the wicked man and the mouth of deceit are opened against me; / They speak to me with a lying tongue.
And with words of hatred they have surrounded me / And have fought against me without cause.
In return for my love they have become my adversaries, / But I am all prayer.
And they have set against me evil in return for good / And hatred in return for my love.
Appoint a wicked man over him, / And let an adversary stand at his right hand.
When he is judged, let him come forth wicked; / And let his prayer be counted as sin.
May his days be few; / May another take his office.
May his children be orphans, / And his wife a widow.
And may his children wander all about and beg, / And may they seek food far from their desolated ruins.
May the creditor seize all that he has, / And may strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.
May there be no one to extend him mercy, / Nor anyone to be kind to his orphans.
May his posterity be cut off; / In the generation following may his name be blotted out.
May his fathers' iniquity be remembered before Jehovah, / And may his mother's sin not be blotted out.
May they be before Jehovah continually, / So that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth;
Because he did not remember to show lovingkindness, / But persecuted the poor and needy and brokenhearted, / To put them to death.
Indeed he loved cursing, so it came on him; / And he took no delight in blessing, so it was far from him.
And he clothed himself with cursing like his garment, / So it came into his inward parts like water / And into his bones like oil.
Let it be to him like the cloak that he wraps around himself, / And as a belt with which he constantly girds himself.
This is the reward from Jehovah for my adversaries / And for those who speak evil against my soul.
But You, O Jehovah Lord, deal with me, / For Your name's sake; / Because Your lovingkindness is good, deliver me.
For I am poor and needy, / And my heart is wounded within me.
I am gone like a shadow that declines; / I am shaken off like the locust.
My knees wobble through fasting, / And my flesh has become lean, without fatness.
I have also become a reproach to them: / When they see me, they shake their heads.
Help me, O Jehovah my God; / Save me according to Your lovingkindness;
And they will know that this is Your hand, / That it is You, O Jehovah, who have done it.
Let them curse, but You bless; / When they arise, they will be put to shame, / And Your servant will rejoice.
May my adversaries be clothed with humiliation, / And may they wrap themselves with their own shame as with a mantle.
I will give much thanks to Jehovah with my mouth, / And in the midst of the multitude I will praise Him;
For He stands at the right hand of the needy / To save him from those who judge his soul.
