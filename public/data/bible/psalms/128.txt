Blessed is everyone who fears Jehovah, / Who walks in His ways.
You will indeed eat the labor of your hands; / You will be blessed, and it will go well with you.
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine / In the innermost parts of your house. / Your children will be like olive shoots / Round about your table.
Thus will the man be blessed / Who fears Jehovah.
Jehovah bless you from Zion; / And may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem / All the days of your life.
May you also see the children of your children. / Peace be upon Israel.
