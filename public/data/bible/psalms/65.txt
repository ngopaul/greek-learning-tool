Praise befits You, O God, in Zion; / And to You is the vow paid.
O You who hear prayer, / To You all flesh comes.
Iniquities prevail against me; / As for our transgressions, You make propitiation for them.
Blessed is he whom You have chosen and bring near / To dwell in Your courts. / We will be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, / Of Your holy temple.
By awesome deeds You answer us in righteousness, / O God of our salvation, / You who are the trust of all the ends of the earth / And of the remotest sea;
Who established the mountains in His strength, / Girded with might;
Who stilled the roaring of the seas, / The roaring of their billows, / And the tumult of the peoples.
And they who dwell in the uttermost parts / Are afraid of Your signs; / You make the exitways of the morning and the evening / Shout for joy.
You visit the earth and water it; / You enrich it greatly: / The river of God is full of water. / You provide men grain, for so You have prepared the earth.
Saturating its furrows, settling its ridges, / You soften it with showers; / You bless its sprouting forth.
You place a crown on a year with Your goodness, / And Your wagon tracks drop fatness;
The wilderness pastures overflow, / And the hills gird themselves with exultation.
The meadows are clothed with the flock, / And the valleys cover themselves in grain; / They shout for joy; indeed they sing.
