I waited patiently on Jehovah, / And He inclined to me / And heard my cry.
Then He brought me up out of a pit of destruction, / Out of the miry clay; / And He set my feet upon a rock, / Establishing my steps.
Then He put a new song in my mouth, / A praise to our God. / Many see it and fear, / And they trust in Jehovah.
Blessed is the man / Who makes Jehovah his trust / And does not turn to the proud / Or to those who turn aside after deception.
Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful deeds which You have done / And Your thoughts toward us; / They cannot be set in order unto You. / Were I to declare and speak of them, / They would be too numerous to recount.
You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; / You have prepared ears for Me; / You do not require burnt offering and sin offering.
Then I said, / Behold, I have come; / In the scroll of the book / It is written concerning Me.
I delight in doing Your will, O My God; / Indeed Your law is within My inward parts.
I bear tidings of righteousness / In the great congregation. / Behold, I will not withhold My lips; / O Jehovah, You know.
I have not hidden Your righteousness / Within My heart; / I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation; / I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great congregation.
You, O Jehovah, do not withhold / Your compassions from me; / May Your lovingkindness and Your truth / Preserve me continually.
For evils encompass me until they cannot be counted; / My iniquities have so overtaken me / That I cannot see; / They are more numerous than the hairs of my head; / Thus my heart fails me.
Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me; / O Jehovah, hasten to help me.
May those who seek my life to destroy it / Be put to shame and confounded together; / May those who take delight in my misfortune / Be turned back and humiliated.
May those who say to me, Aha! Aha! / Be desolate because of their shame.
May all those who seek You / Be glad and rejoice in You; / May those who love Your salvation say continually, / May Jehovah be magnified!
But I am poor and needy; / May the Lord think about me. / You are my help and my Deliverer; / O my God, do not delay.
