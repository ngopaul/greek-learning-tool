Unless Jehovah builds the house, / Those who build it labor in vain. / Unless Jehovah keeps the city, / The guard watches in vain.
It is vain for you to rise up early, / To stay up late, / To eat the bread of toil; / All the same, He gives to His beloved while they sleep.
Behold, children are the heritage of Jehovah, / The fruit of the womb a reward.
Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, / So are the children of one's youth.
Blessed is the man / Who fills his quiver with them. / He will not be put to shame / When he speaks with enemies in the gate.
