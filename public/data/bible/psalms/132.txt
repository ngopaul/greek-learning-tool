Remember, O Jehovah, for David's sake / All his afflictions;
How he swore to Jehovah / And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
I shall not go into the tent of my house; / I shall not go up onto the couch of my bed;
I shall not give sleep to my eyes, / Slumber to my eyelids;
Until I find a place for Jehovah, / A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.
Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; / We found it in the fields of Jaar.
We will go into His tabernacle; / We will worship at His footstool.
Arise, O Jehovah, unto Your resting place, / You and the Ark of Your strength.
Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, / And let Your faithful ones give a ringing shout.
For the sake of David Your servant, / Do not turn away the face of Your Anointed One.
Jehovah has sworn unto David in truth; / He will not turn from it: / Of the fruit of your body I will set One upon your throne.
If your children keep My covenant / And My testimonies that I will teach them, / Their children also will sit / Upon your throne forever.
For Jehovah has chosen Zion; / He has desired it for His habitation.
This is My resting place forever; / Here will I dwell, for I have desired it.
I will abundantly bless its provision; / I will satisfy its poor with bread.
And its priests I will clothe with salvation, / And its faithful ones will shout with a ringing shout.
There I will cause a horn of David to shoot forth; / I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.
I will clothe his enemies with shame, / But on him his crown will shine.
