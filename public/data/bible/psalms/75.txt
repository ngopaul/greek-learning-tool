We give thanks to You, O God; we give thanks, / For Your name is near; men tell of Your wondrous deeds.
When I choose the appointed time, / It is I who judge with equity.
The earth and all who dwell in it melt; / I have established its pillars. Selah
I said to the boastful, Do not boast; / And to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn.
Do not lift your horn on high; / Do not speak arrogantly with a haughty neck.
For neither from the east nor from the west, / And neither from the south, does exaltation come;
For God is the Judge: / He puts this one down and exalts that one.
For there is a cup in the hand of Jehovah, / And the wine foams; it is full of mixture, / And He pours from it; indeed its dregs will all the wicked of the earth / Drain off and drink up.
But as for me, I will declare forever, / I will sing psalms to the God of Jacob.
And all the horns of the wicked will I cut off, / But the horns of the righteous man will be exalted.
