How long, O Jehovah? Will You forget me continually? / How long will You hide Your face from me?
How long will I take counsel in my soul / And sorrow in my heart day after day? / How long will my enemy be exalted over me?
Consider and answer me, O Jehovah my God; / Enlighten my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death,
Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him, / And my adversaries exult when I am shaken.
But I trust in Your lovingkindness; / My heart will exult in Your salvation;
I will sing to Jehovah, / For He has dealt bountifully with me.
