Jehovah declares to my Lord, / Sit at My right hand / Until I make Your enemies / Your footstool.
Jehovah will send forth / The scepter of Your strength from Zion: / Rule in the midst of Your enemies.
Your people will offer themselves willingly / In the day of Your warfare, / In the splendor of their consecration. / Your young men will be to You / Like the dew from the womb of the dawn.
Jehovah has sworn, / And He will not change: / You are a Priest forever / According to the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord is at Your right hand; / He will shatter kings in the day of His anger.
He will execute judgment among the nations; / He will fill the place with corpses; / He will shatter the head / Over a great land.
He will drink from the brook by the way; / Therefore He will lift up His head.
