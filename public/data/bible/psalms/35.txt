Strive, O Jehovah, with those who strive with me; / Battle against those who battle against me.
Take hold of buckler and shield, / And rise up as my help.
Draw out also the spear, and close up the way / Against those who pursue me; / Say to my soul, / I am your salvation.
Let those who seek my life / Be put to shame and humiliated; / Let those who devise evil for me / Be turned back and confounded.
Let them be like chaff before the wind, / With the angel of Jehovah driving them on.
Let their way be darkness and slipperiness itself, / With the angel of Jehovah pursuing them.
For without cause they hid their net for me; / Without cause they dug a pit for me.
Let destruction come upon him unawares, / And let his net, which he hid, catch him; / Let him fall into it, into destruction.
Then my soul will exult in Jehovah; / It will rejoice in His salvation.
All my bones will say, / Jehovah, who is like You, / Who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him, / And the poor and needy from him who robs him?
Malicious witnesses rise up; / They ask me about things I know nothing of.
They repay me evil for good; / I am bereaved in soul.
But I, when they were sick, / Had sackcloth as my clothing; / I afflicted my soul with fasting, / And my prayer returned to my own bosom.
I conducted myself as if it had been my friend or my brother; / Like one mourning for his mother, I bowed down gloomily.
But at my stumbling they rejoice and gather together; / The attackers whom I did not know / Gather together against me; / They tear at me and do not cease.
As profane mocking parasites, / They gnash their teeth at me.
O Lord, how long will You look on? / Rescue my soul from their destruction, / My precious life from the lions.
I will give You thanks in the great congregation; / Among a mighty people I will praise You.
Do not let those who are wrongly my enemies rejoice over me; / Do not let those who hate me without cause narrow their eyes at me.
For they do not speak peace, / But devise words of deceit / Against the quiet people of the land.
And they open their mouth wide against me; / They say, Aha! Aha! Our eyes have seen it.
You have seen, O Jehovah; do not be silent. / O Lord, do not be far from me.
Awake, and stir Yourself for my cause, / For my claim, O my God and my Lord.
Vindicate me according to Your righteousness, O Jehovah my God; / And do not let them rejoice over me.
Do not let them say in their heart, / Aha! That is what we wanted. / Do not let them say, We have swallowed him up.
May those who rejoice at my trouble / Be ashamed and confounded together; / May those who magnify themselves against me / Be clothed with shame and humiliation.
May those who delight in the vindication of my righteousness / Give a ringing shout and rejoice, / And may they say continually, / Jehovah be magnified, / Who delights in the well-being of His servant.
And my tongue will declare Your righteousness / And Your praise all day long.
