Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, / But to Your name give glory, / For the sake of Your lovingkindness and Your truth.
Why should the nations say, / Where then is their God?
But our God is in the heavens; / He does whatever He pleases.
Their idols are mere silver and gold, / The work of human hands.
They have mouths, but they do not speak; / They have eyes, but they do not see.
They have ears, but they do not hear; / They have noses, but they do not smell.
They have hands, but they do not feel; / They have feet, but they do not walk; / They make no sound in their throat.
Those who make them, / All who trust in them, / Are like them.
O Israel, trust in Jehovah. / He is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah. / He is their help and their shield.
O you who fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah. / He is their help and their shield.
Jehovah has been mindful of us; He will bless us; / He will bless the house of Israel; / He will bless the house of Aaron;
He will bless those who fear Jehovah, / Both small and great.
May Jehovah give you increase, / Both you and your children.
May you be blessed of Jehovah, / Maker of heaven and earth.
The heavens are the heavens of Jehovah, / But He has given the earth to the children of men.
The dead do not praise Jehovah, / Nor do any that go down into silence.
But we will bless Jehovah / From now and to eternity. / Hallelujah.
