I said, I will keep my ways, / So that I do not sin with my tongue; / I will keep a muzzle on my mouth / When the wicked are before me.
I was dumb and silent; / I held my peace, even from good; / And my pain was stirred up.
My heart was hot within me; / While I mused, the fire burned; / I spoke with my tongue:
O Jehovah, cause me to know my end, / And the measure of my days, what it is. / May I know how transient I am.
Behold, You have made my days as mere handbreadths, / And my lifetime is as nothing before You; / Surely every man at his best is altogether vanity. Selah
Surely man goes about as a semblance; / Surely they bustle about in vain: / He heaps up riches yet knows not / Who will gather them.
And now what am I waiting for, O Lord? / My hope--it is in You.
Deliver me from all my transgressions; / Do not make me the fool's reproach.
I was dumb; I did not open my mouth; / For You have done this.
Remove Your plague from me; / By the hostility of Your hand I am consumed.
With rebukes You chasten a man because of iniquity, / And cause what is desirous to him to disappear like a moth. / Surely every man is vanity. Selah
Hear my prayer, O Jehovah; / And give ear to my cry; / Do not hold Your peace at my tears. / For I am a stranger with You, / A sojourner, as all my fathers were.
Look away from me, that I may be cheerful, / Before I go away and am no more.
