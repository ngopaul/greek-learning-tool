I will lift up my eyes to the hills. / From where will my help come?
My help comes from Jehovah, / Who made heaven and earth.
He will not let your foot slip; / He who keeps you will not slumber.
Behold, Israel's Keeper / Will neither slumber nor sleep.
Jehovah is your Keeper; / Jehovah is your shade at your right hand.
The sun will not strike you by day, / Nor the moon by night.
Jehovah will keep you from all evil; / He will keep your soul.
Jehovah will keep your going out and your coming in / From now and to eternity.
