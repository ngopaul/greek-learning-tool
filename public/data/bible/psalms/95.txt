Come, let us sing for joy to Jehovah; / Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving; / Let us make a joyful noise to Him with psalms.
For Jehovah is a great God / And a great King above all gods.
In His hand are the depths of the earth; / The heights of the mountains are His also.
The sea is His, and He made it; / And His hands formed the dry land.
Come, let us worship and bow down; / Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker.
For He is our God, / And we are the people of His pasture / And the flock of His hand. / Today, if you hear His voice,
Do not harden your heart as at Meribah, / As in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
When your fathers tested Me; / They tried Me, even though they had seen My work.
For forty years I loathed that generation, / And I said, They are a people who go astray in heart; / And they do not know My ways;
Therefore I swore in My anger: / They shall by no means enter into My rest!
