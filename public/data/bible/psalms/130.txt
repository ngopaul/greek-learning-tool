Out of the depths I have called upon You, O Jehovah.
O Lord, hear my voice; / Let Your ears be attentive / To the voice of my supplications.
If You, O Jehovah, marked iniquities, / Who, O Lord, would stand?
But with You there is forgiveness, / That You would be feared.
I wait for Jehovah; my soul waits, / And in His word I hope.
My soul waits for the Lord / More than watchmen for the morning, / Yes, watchmen for the morning.
Hope in Jehovah, O Israel; / For with Jehovah there is lovingkindness, / And with Him abundantly there is redemption;
And it is He who will redeem Israel / From all its iniquities.
