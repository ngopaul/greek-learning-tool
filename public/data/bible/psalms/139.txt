O Jehovah, You have searched me and known me.
You know when I sit down and when I rise up; / You understand my thoughts from afar.
You thoroughly search my path and my lying down, / And You are acquainted with all my ways.
For a word is not yet on my tongue, / And already You, O Jehovah, know it completely.
You have closed in on me behind and before / And have laid Your hand on me.
Oh, knowledge too wonderful for me! / It is so high; I cannot attain to it.
Where shall I go, away from Your Spirit, / And where shall I flee from Your presence?
If I ascend into heaven, You are there; / If I make my bed in Sheol, there You are.
If I take the wings of the dawn / And settle at the limits of the sea,
There also Your hand will lead me, / And Your right hand will take hold of me.
And if I say, Surely darkness will cover me, / And the light around me will be night;
Even the darkness is not dark to You, / And night shines like day; / The darkness is like the light.
For it was You who formed my inward parts; / You wove me together in my mother's womb.
I will praise You, for I am awesomely and wonderfully made; / Your works are wonderful, / And my soul knows it well.
My frame was not hidden from You / When I was made in secret, / Skillfully fashioned in the depths of the earth.
Your eyes saw my unformed substance; / And in Your book all of them were written: / The days that were ordained for me, / When not one of them was yet.
And how precious are Your thoughts to me, O God! / How great is the sum of them!
If I should count them, they would be more than the sand. / When I awake, I am still with You.
Oh that You, O God, would slay the wicked--/ Depart from me therefore, you men of bloodshed--
Those who speak of You with evil intent, / Who as Your enemies take Your name in vain.
Do I not hate those who hate You, O Jehovah? / And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?
I hate them with a perfect hatred; / They have become my own enemies.
Search me, O God, and know my heart; / Try me, and know my anxious thoughts;
And see if there is some harmful way in me, / And lead me on the eternal way.
