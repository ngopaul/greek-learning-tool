Save me, O God; for the waters / Threaten my life.
I sink in deep mire, / And there is no place to stand; / I have come to the depths of water, / And the flood flows over me.
I am weary of my crying; / My throat is parched; / My eyes fail / While I wait for my God.
More numerous than the hairs of my head / Are those who hate me without cause; / Mighty are those who would destroy me, / Those who are wrongly my enemies. / What I did not steal, / I must then restore.
O God, You know my foolishness, / And my sins of guilt are not hidden from You.
Do not let those who wait on You be put to shame because of me, / O Lord Jehovah of hosts; / Do not let those who seek You be humiliated because of me, / O God of Israel.
Because for Your sake I have borne reproach; / Humiliation has covered my face.
I have become a stranger to my brothers, / And a foreigner to my mother's children.
For the zeal of Your house has devoured me, / And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.
When I wept, when my soul was in fasting, / That became a reproach to me.
When I made sackcloth my clothing, / I became a proverb to them.
Those who sit in the gate talk about me, / And I am the mocking song of those who drink liquor.
But as for me, my prayer is to You, / O Jehovah, in an acceptable time; / O God, in the abundance of Your lovingkindness answer me, / In the faithfulness of Your salvation.
Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; / May I be delivered from those who hate me, / And out of the depths of water.
Do not let the flood of water flow over me, / Nor let the deep swallow me, / Nor let the pit close its mouth over me.
Answer me, O Jehovah; for Your lovingkindness is good; / According to the abundance of Your compassions turn to me.
And do not hide Your face from Your servant, / For I am in distress; hurry and answer me.
Draw near to my soul; redeem it; / Ransom me because of my enemies.
You know my reproach / And my shame and my humiliation; / All my adversaries are before You.
Reproach has broken my heart, / And I am sick; / I looked for pity, but there was none; / And for comforters, but I found none.
But they gave me gall for my food, / And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
May their table become a snare before them / And a trap when they are at peace.
May their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see; / And make their loins shake continually.
Pour out Your indignation upon them; / And may the burning fierceness of Your anger overtake them.
May their camp be desolate; / May there be no one to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom You have stricken, / And they recount the pain of those whom You have wounded.
Add iniquity to their iniquity, / And do not let them come into Your righteousness.
May they be blotted out of the book of life, / And may they not be written with the righteous.
But I am poor and pained; / May Your salvation, O God, set me on high.
I will praise the name of God with a song / And will magnify Him with thanksgiving;
And it will be better to Jehovah than an ox / Or a bull with horns and hooves.
The meek have seen it; they rejoice. / You who seek God, let your heart revive.
For Jehovah listens to the needy, / And He does not despise His prisoners.
Let the heavens and the earth praise Him, / The seas and everything that moves in them.
For God will save Zion / And build the cities of Judah; / And they will abide there and possess it.
And the seed of His servants will inherit it, / And those who love His name will dwell in it.
