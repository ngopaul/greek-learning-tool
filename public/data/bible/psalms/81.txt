Sing for joy to God our strength; / Make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.
Lift up a song and sound the tambourine, / The pleasant lyre with the harp.
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, / At the full moon, on our feast day.
For that is a statute of Israel, / An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
He appointed it as a testimony in Joseph / When He went out over the land of Egypt. / I heard a language that I did not know:
I turned your shoulder from the burden; / Your hands were freed from the basket.
You called in trouble, and I delivered you; / I answered you from the secret place of thunder; / I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
Hear, O My people, and I will testify against you: / O Israel, if you would listen to Me!
There shall be no strange god among you, / Neither shall you worship any foreign god.
I am Jehovah your God, / Who brought you up out of the land of Egypt; / Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
But My people did not listen to My voice, / And Israel would not consent to Me.
So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart: / They walked after their own counsels.
Oh that My people had listened to Me, / That Israel had walked in My ways!
I would have soon subdued their enemies / And turned My hand against their adversaries.
Those who hate Jehovah would have come cringing to Him, / And their time would be forever.
And He would have fed them with the finest of wheat; / Indeed with honey from the rock I would have satisfied you.
