O God, You have rejected us; You have broken out upon us; / You have been angry. Restore us.
You have caused the earth to quake; You have split it open. / Heal the breaks in it, for it totters.
You have shown Your people hard things; / You have made us drink wine to stagger us.
You have given a banner to those who fear You, / To be displayed because of the truth. Selah
That Your beloved ones may be delivered, / Save with Your right hand, and answer us.
God has spoken in His holiness: I will exult; / I will divide Shechem / And measure out the Valley of Succoth.
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine, / And Ephraim is the helmet for My head; / Judah is My scepter.
Moab is My washbowl; / Upon Edom I will cast My sandal; / Philistia, shout aloud because of Me.
Who will bring me into the besieged city? / Who will lead me to Edom?
Will not You, O God, who rejected us / And who did not go forth, O God, with our armies?
Give us help from the adversary, / For a salvation by man is vain.
In God we will do valiantly, / And it is He who will tread down our adversaries.
