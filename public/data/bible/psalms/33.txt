Rejoice in Jehovah, O righteous ones. / Praise is becoming to the upright.
Give thanks to Jehovah with the lyre; / With the harp of ten strings sing psalms to Him.
Sing Him a new song; / Play skillfully with a joyous shout.
For the word of Jehovah is right, / And all His work is done in faithfulness.
He loves righteousness and justice; / The earth is full of the lovingkindness of Jehovah.
By the word of Jehovah the heavens were made, / And all their host, by the breath of His mouth.
He gathers the water of the sea like a heap; / He puts the deep waters into storage places.
Let all the earth fear Jehovah; / Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
For He spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood.
Jehovah brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; / He frustrates the intentions of the peoples.
The counsel of Jehovah stands forever; / The intentions of His heart stand from generation to generation.
Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, / The people whom He has chosen as His own possession.
Jehovah looks from heaven; / He sees all the sons of men.
From the site of His habitation He gazes / At all the inhabitants of the earth,
He who fashions the hearts of them all, / He who discerns all their works.
No king is saved by a great army; / A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
A horse is a vain thing for salvation, / And it cannot deliver by its great power.
Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon those who fear Him, / Upon those who hope in His lovingkindness,
To deliver their soul from death / And to preserve them alive in famine.
Our soul waits on Jehovah; / He is our help and our shield;
For in Him our heart rejoices, / Because in His holy name we trust.
May Your lovingkindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, / Even as we have hoped in You.
