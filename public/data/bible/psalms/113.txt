Hallelujah! / Praise, you servants of Jehovah, / Praise the name of Jehovah.
Let the name of Jehovah be blessed, / From now and to eternity.
From the rising of the sun to its setting / The name of Jehovah is to be praised.
Jehovah is high above all the nations, / And His glory is above the heavens.
Who is like Jehovah our God, / Who has set His throne on high,
Who humbles Himself to behold / The heavens and the earth?
He raises the poor from the dust; / From the ash heap He lifts the needy;
That He may seat them with princes, / With the princes of His people.
He causes the barren woman to keep house / As a joyful mother of children. / Hallelujah.
