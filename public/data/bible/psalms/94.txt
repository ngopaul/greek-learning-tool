O God of vengeance, O Jehovah, / O God of vengeance, shine forth!
Lift Yourself up, O Judge of the earth; / Render the reward upon the proud.
How long, O Jehovah, will the wicked, / How long will the wicked exult?
They burst out; they speak arrogantly; / All the workers of iniquity boast.
They crush Your people, O Jehovah, / And afflict Your inheritance.
They slay the widow and the stranger, / And they murder orphans.
And they say, Jehovah does not see, / And the God of Jacob does not consider.
Consider, you senseless ones among the people; / And you foolish ones, when will you become wise?
He who planted the ear, does He not hear? / And He who formed the eye, does He not see?
He who disciplines the nations, / He who teaches man knowledge, does He not reprove?
Jehovah knows the thoughts of man, / That they are vanity.
Blessed is the man / Whom You discipline, O Jehovah, / And teach out of Your law;
That You may give him rest from the days of evil / Until the pit is dug for the wicked.
For Jehovah will not abandon His people, / Nor will He forsake His inheritance.
For judgment will return unto righteousness, / And all the upright in heart will follow it.
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? / Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
Unless Jehovah had been my help, / My soul would have soon dwelt in silence.
When I said, My foot has slipped, / Your lovingkindness, O Jehovah, upheld me.
When my disquieting thoughts within me are many, / Your comfortings delight my soul.
Shall the seat of destruction be united with You, / Which devises trouble through its statutes?
They band together against the soul of the righteous man / And condemn innocent blood.
But Jehovah has been my high tower, / And my God the rock of my refuge;
And He will return their iniquity upon them / And destroy them in their own evil; / Jehovah our God will destroy them.
