Jehovah, how many are my adversaries! / Many are those who rise up against me!
Many are those who say of my soul, / There is no salvation for him in God! Selah
But You, O Jehovah, are a shield around me, / My glory and the One who lifts up my head.
With my voice I call out to Jehovah, / And He answers me from His holy mountain. Selah
I lay down and slept; / I awoke, for Jehovah sustains me.
I will not fear the myriads of the people / Who have set themselves against me all around.
Arise, O Jehovah; / Save me, O my God! / Oh that You would strike all my enemies on the cheek; / And break the teeth of the wicked.
Salvation is of Jehovah: / Your blessing be upon Your people. Selah
