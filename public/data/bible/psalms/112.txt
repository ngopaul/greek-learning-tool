Hallelujah! / Blessed is the man who fears Jehovah, / Who delights greatly in His commandments.
His seed will be mighty on the earth; / The generation of the upright will be blessed.
Wealth and riches are in his house, / And his righteousness endures forever.
Light in the darkness arises to the upright; / They are gracious and compassionate and righteous.
It is well with the man who is gracious and lends; / He will maintain his cause in judgment.
For he will never be moved; / The righteous man will be remembered forever.
He will not be afraid of evil tidings; / His heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah.
His heart is sustained, he is not afraid, / Until he sees what should happen to his adversaries.
He has scattered abroad; he has given to the needy; / His righteousness endures forever; / His horn will be exalted with honor.
The wicked man will see it and be angry; / He will gnash his teeth and melt away; / The desire of the wicked will perish.
