Deliver me, O Jehovah, from evil men; / From violent men preserve me;
Who devise evil schemes in their hearts / And continually stir up wars.
They have sharpened their tongues like that of a serpent; / The poison of adders is under their lips. Selah
Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; / From violent men preserve me; / Who devise schemes to thrust me down.
The proud have hidden a trap for me and cords; / They have spread a net by the wayside; / They have set snares for me. Selah
I said to Jehovah, You are my God; / Give ear, O Jehovah, to the voice of my supplications.
O Jehovah Lord, strength of my salvation, / You have covered my head in the day of battle.
O Jehovah, do not grant the desires of the wicked man; / Do not let his evil scheme advance, / Lest he be exalted. Selah
As for the head of those who surround me, / May the mischief of their own lips cover them.
May burning coals drop down upon them; / May they be thrown down into the fire, / Into deep pits, never to rise again.
Let no slanderer be established in the land; / Let evil hunt down the violent man speedily.
I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted / And justice for the needy.
Surely the righteous will give thanks to Your name; / The upright will dwell in Your presence.
