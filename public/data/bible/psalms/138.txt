I will give You thanks with all my heart; / Before the gods I will sing psalms to You.
I will bow toward Your holy temple / And give thanks to Your name / For Your lovingkindness and Your truth, / For You have magnified Your word above all Your name.
On the day that I called out, You answered me; / You encouraged me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth will give thanks to You, O Jehovah; / For they have heard the words of Your mouth.
And they will sing of the ways of Jehovah, / For great is the glory of Jehovah.
For though Jehovah is high, He regards the lowly; / And the haughty He knows from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, / You will preserve me; / Against the wrath of my enemies You will stretch out Your hand, / And Your right hand will save me.
Jehovah will complete that which concerns me. / O Jehovah, Your lovingkindness is forever; / Do not forsake the works of Your own hands.
