Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, / For His lovingkindness is forever.
Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, / Whom He redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
And gathered out of the lands, / From the east and from the west, / From the north and from the south.
They wandered in the wilderness, on the desert way; / They found no city of habitation.
Hungry and thirsty, / Their soul fainted within them.
Then they cried out to Jehovah in their trouble, / And He delivered them from their distresses.
And He led them on a straight way / That they might come to a city of habitation.
Let them give thanks to Jehovah for His lovingkindness / And for His wondrous deeds to the children of men.
For He satisfies the thirsty soul, / And the famished soul He fills with good.
Some inhabited darkness and the shadow of death, / And were bound in affliction and irons,
Because they rebelled against the words of God / And spurned the counsel of the Most High;
Therefore He brought down their heart with labor; / They stumbled, and there was no one to help them.
Then they cried out to Jehovah in their trouble, / And He saved them from their distresses.
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, / And He broke apart their bonds.
Let them give thanks to Jehovah for His lovingkindness / And for His wondrous deeds to the children of men.
For He breaks down the doors of bronze / And cuts down the bars of iron.
Some were fools, because of their way of transgression; / And because of their iniquities, they were afflicted.
Their soul loathed all food, / And they drew near to the gates of death.
Then they cried out to Jehovah in their trouble, / And He saved them out of their distresses.
He sent forth His word and healed them, / And He delivered them from the pits of destruction.
Let them give thanks to Jehovah for His lovingkindness / And for His wondrous deeds to the children of men.
And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving / And declare His doings in joyful song.
Those who go down to the sea in ships, / Conducting business on the mighty waters,
These see Jehovah's doings / And His wondrous deeds in the deep.
For He commanded and raised up a storm wind, / And it lifted up the waves of the sea.
They mounted up to the heavens; they went down to the depths; / Their soul melted in the calamity.
They reeled and staggered like a drunken man, / And all their skill was swallowed up.
Then they cried out to Jehovah in their trouble, / And He brought them out of their distresses.
He made the storm be still, / And the waves of the sea were calm;
And they rejoiced that they were quiet, / And He brought them to the haven they desired.
Let them give thanks to Jehovah for His lovingkindness / And for His wondrous deeds to the children of men.
And let them exalt Him in the congregation of the people / And praise Him in the assembly of the elders.
He turns rivers into a wilderness, / And springs of water into thirsty ground;
Fruitful land into a salt flat, / Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
He turns a wilderness into a pool of water, / And a dry land into springs of water.
And He makes the hungry dwell there, / That they may prepare a city of habitation
And sow fields and plant vineyards / And get a fruitful yield.
He also blesses them, and they are multiplied greatly; / And He does not let their cattle decrease.
When they are diminished and bowed down / Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,
He pours contempt on princes, / And makes them wander in a pathless waste.
But He raises the needy man high above affliction / And makes his families like flocks.
The upright see it and rejoice; / And all iniquity stops its mouth.
Who is wise? Then let him observe these things / And consider the lovingkindness of Jehovah.
