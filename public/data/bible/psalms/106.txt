Hallelujah. / Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, / For His lovingkindness is forever.
Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, / Or declare all His praise?
Blessed are those who maintain justice, / Who execute righteousness at all times.
Remember me, O Jehovah, with Your favor toward Your people; / Visit me with Your salvation,
That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, / That I may rejoice in the joy of Your nation, / That I may glory with Your inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers; / We committed iniquity; we have acted wickedly.
Our fathers in Egypt / Did not understand Your wonders; / They did not remember the multitude of Your acts of lovingkindness, / But rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.
But He saved them for His name's sake, / That He might make His power known.
Thus He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; / And He led them through the depths as through the wilderness.
And He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, / And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
The water then covered their adversaries; / Not one of them was left.
Then they believed His words; / They sang His praise.
Soon they forgot His works; / They did not wait for His counsel,
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, / And tempted God in the desert.
And He gave them their request, / But He sent leanness into their soul.
And they were jealous of Moses in the camp / And of Aaron, the holy one of Jehovah.
The earth opened, and it swallowed up Dathan / And covered the company of Abiram.
And a fire burned among their company; / A flame engulfed the wicked.
They made a calf in Horeb, / And worshipped a molten image.
Thus they exchanged their glory / For the image of an ox that eats grass.
They forgot God their Savior, / Who had done great things in Egypt,
Wondrous deeds in the land of Ham, / Awesome things by the Red Sea.
Therefore He said that He would destroy them, / And would have, had not Moses His chosen one / Stood in the breach before Him / To turn away His wrath from destroying them.
Then they despised the pleasant land; / They did not believe in His word;
Rather they murmured in their tents; / They did not listen to the voice of Jehovah.
Therefore He lifted up His hand and swore to them / That He would make them fall in the wilderness,
And that He would make their seed fall among the nations, / And that He would disperse them among the lands.
Then they joined themselves to Baal-peor, / And ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
Thus they provoked Him to anger by their actions, / And the plague broke out among them.
Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, / And the plague was stayed;
And it has been accounted to him as righteousness / From generation to generation unto eternity.
Then they angered Him at the waters of Meribah, / So that it went ill with Moses on account of them;
For they rebelled against His Spirit, / And he spoke rashly with his lips.
They did not destroy the peoples, / As Jehovah had commanded them;
But they mingled themselves with the nations / And learned their practices.
And they served their idols, / Which became a snare to them.
They also sacrificed their sons / And their daughters to demons,
And poured out innocent blood, / The blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; / And the land was polluted with bloodshed.
Thus they were defiled by their practices, / And went about as harlots by their actions.
And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against His people, / And He abhorred His inheritance.
And He gave them over into the hand of the nations: / And those who hated them ruled over them,
And their enemies oppressed them, / And they were subdued under their hand.
Many times He delivered them, / But they were rebellious in their counsel, / And they were brought low in their iniquity.
Yet He regarded their distress / When He heard their cry,
And for their sake He remembered His covenant, / And repented according to the multitude of His acts of lovingkindness;
And He caused them to find compassion / With all their captors.
Save us, O Jehovah our God; / And gather us out of the nations, / That we may give thanks to Your holy name, / That we may glory in Your praise.
Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, / From eternity to eternity. / And let all the people say, Amen. / Hallelujah.
