Hallelujah! / For it is good to sing psalms to our God; / For it is pleasant; praise is fitting.
Jehovah builds up Jerusalem; / He gathers the outcasts of Israel.
He heals the brokenhearted / And binds up their wounds.
He counts the number of the stars; / He calls them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; / His understanding is infinite.
Jehovah uplifts the lowly; / He brings the wicked down to the ground.
Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; / Sing psalms to our God with the lyre;
Who covers the heavens with clouds, / Who prepares rain for the earth, / Who causes grass to grow on the mountains,
Who gives to the beast its food, / And to the young ravens who cry.
He takes no delight in the strength of horses; / Nor pleasure in the legs of man.
Jehovah takes pleasure in those who fear Him, / In those who hope in His lovingkindness.
Laud Jehovah, O Jerusalem; / Praise your God, O Zion;
For He has strengthened the bars of your gates; / He has blessed your children within you.
He makes peace in your borders; / He satisfies you with the finest wheat.
He sends forth His command to the earth; / His word runs very swiftly.
He gives snow like wool; / He scatters frost like ashes;
He casts His hail like crumbs--/ Who can stand before His cold?
He sends forth His word and melts them; / He causes His wind to blow; the waters flow.
He declares His word to Jacob, / His statutes and His ordinances to Israel.
He has not dealt so with any other nation; / And as for His ordinances, they have not known them. / Hallelujah!
