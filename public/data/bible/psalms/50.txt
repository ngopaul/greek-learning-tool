The Mighty One, God Jehovah, / Speaks and summons the earth / From the rising of the sun to its setting.
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, / God shines forth.
Our God has come and will not be silent; / Fire devours before Him, / And around Him it is exceedingly tempestuous.
He calls to the heavens above, / And to the earth that He may judge His people:
Gather My saints to Me, / Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.
Then the heavens declare His righteousness, / For God Himself is Judge. Selah
Hear, O My people, and I will speak; / O Israel, and I will testify against you: / I am God, your God.
I will not reprove you because of your sacrifices, / And your burnt offerings are before Me continually.
I will not take a bull from your house / Nor goats from your folds,
For every animal of the forest is Mine, / The cattle upon a thousand hills.
I know every bird of the mountains, / And I am aware of everything that moves in the field.
If I were hungry, I would not tell you; / For the world is Mine and the fullness thereof.
Shall I eat the flesh of bulls / Or drink the blood of goats?
Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, / And repay your vows to the Most High;
And call upon Me in the day of trouble: / I will deliver you, and you will glorify Me.
But to the wicked God says, / What right do you have to declare My statutes / And take up My covenant in your mouth,
Seeing that you hate correction / And cast My words behind you?
When you see a thief, you take pleasure in him; / And your portion is with adulterers.
You let your mouth loose for evil, / And your tongue frames deceit.
You sit and speak against your brother; / You defame the son of your mother.
These things you do, and I keep silent; / You think that I am altogether like you. / I will rebuke you and set forth the matter in order before your eyes.
Consider this then, you who forget God, / Lest I tear you apart and there be none to deliver you.
Whoever offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies Me; / And to him who sets his way right I will show the salvation of God.
