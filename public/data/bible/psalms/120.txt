In my distress I called out to Jehovah, / And He answered me.
O Jehovah, deliver my soul from lying lips, / From a tongue of deceit.
What should be given to you, / And what further shall be done to you, / O tongue of deceit?
The sharp arrows of a mighty man, / With the burning coals of the broom tree!
Woe is me, for I sojourn in Meshech, / I dwell among the tents of Kedar.
Long has my soul had its dwelling / With him who hates peace.
I am for peace; but when I speak, / They are for war.
