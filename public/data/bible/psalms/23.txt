Jehovah is my Shepherd; I will lack nothing.
He makes me lie down in green pastures; / He leads me beside waters of rest.
He restores my soul; / He guides me on the paths of righteousness / For His name's sake.
Even though I walk / Through the valley of the shadow of death, / I do not fear evil, / For You are with me; / Your rod and Your staff, / They comfort me.
You spread a table before me / In the presence of my adversaries; / You anoint my head with oil; / My cup runs over.
Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me / All the days of my life, / And I will dwell in the house of Jehovah / For the length of my days.
