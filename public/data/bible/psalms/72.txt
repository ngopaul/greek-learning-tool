O God, give Your judgments to the king, / And Your righteousness to the son of the king.
He will judge Your people in righteousness, / And Your poor with justice.
The mountains will bear peace to the people, / And the hills, in righteousness.
He will judge the poor of the people; / He will save the children of the needy / And crush the oppressor.
They will fear You as long as the sun endures / And as long as the moon endures / Throughout the generations.
He will drop like rain upon mown grass, / Like abundant showers dripping on the earth.
In His days the righteous will flourish, / And there will be an abundance of peace / Until the moon is no more.
And He will have dominion from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth.
The desert dwellers will bow down before Him, / And His enemies will lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands / Will pay tribute; / The kings of Sheba and Seba / Will present gifts.
And all the kings will bow down before Him; / All the nations will serve Him.
For He will deliver the needy man when he cries, / And the poor man who has no one to help him.
He will have pity on the weak and needy, / And the souls of the needy He will save.
From oppression and violence / He will redeem their soul, / And their blood will be precious in His sight.
So He shall live and to Him shall be given / The gold of Sheba; / And prayer shall be made continually for Him; / He shall be blessed all the day long.
There will be an abundance of grain on the earth, / Even at the tops of the mountains. / Its fruit will wave like the forests of Lebanon, / And those of the city will blossom like the foliage of the earth.
His name will be forever; / As long as the sun endures, His name will spread; / And men will be blessed in Him; / All the nations will call Him blessed.
Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, / Who alone does wondrous deeds;
And blessed be His glorious name forever; / And may His glory fill the whole earth. / Amen and Amen.
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
