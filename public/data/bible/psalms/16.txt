Preserve me, O God, for I take refuge in You.
I say to Jehovah, You are my Lord; / No good have I beyond You;
As for the saints who are on the earth, they are the excellent; / All my delight is in them.
The sorrows of them who bartered for some other god will be multiplied; / Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, / Nor will I take up their names upon my lips.
Jehovah is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup; / You maintain my lot.
The measuring lines have fallen on pleasant places for me; / Indeed the inheritance is beautiful to me.
I will bless Jehovah, who counsels me; / Indeed in the nights my inward parts instruct me.
I have set Jehovah before me continually; / Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.
Therefore my heart rejoices and my glory exults; / Even my flesh dwells securely.
For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, / Nor let Your Holy One see the pit.
You will make known to me the path of life; / In Your presence is fullness of joy; / At Your right hand there are pleasures forever.
