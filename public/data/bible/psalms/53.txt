The fool has said in his heart, / There is no God. / They are corrupt and commit abominable deeds; / There is none who does good.
God looked down from heaven / Upon the sons of men / To see if there was anyone who had insight, / Who seeks after God.
All of them have turned back; / They are together perverse. / There is none who does good; / There is not even one.
Have they no knowledge, the workers of iniquity, / Who eat up my people as they would eat up bread / And do not call upon God?
There they were in great fear, / Where there was no fear. / For God scattered the bones / Of him who encamped against you. / You put them to shame / Because God has rejected them.
Oh that the salvation of Israel might come forth from Zion! / When God turns the captivity of His people, / Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice.
