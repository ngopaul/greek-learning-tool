Give ear, O God, to my prayer; / And do not hide Yourself from my supplication.
Give heed to me, and answer me. / I grow restless in my complaint and moan,
Because of the voice of the enemy, / Because of the oppression of the wicked man; / For they drop iniquity upon me, / And in anger they make me their enemy.
My heart writhes within me, / And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
Fear and trembling have come upon me, / And shuddering overwhelms me.
And I say, Oh that I had wings like a dove! / Then I would fly away and be at rest.
Indeed I would wander far away; / I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah
I would hasten my escape / From the storm wind and the tempest.
Confuse, O Lord, divide their tongue; / For I have seen violence and contention in the city.
Day and night they go around it, / Upon its walls; / And iniquity and trouble are in the midst of it.
Utter ruin is in the midst of it, / And oppression and deceit / Do not depart from its streets.
For it is not an enemy who reproaches me; / Otherwise I could bear it. / It is not he who hates me who magnifies himself against me; / Otherwise I could hide myself from him.
But it is you, my equal, / My close friend and my acquaintance.
We were in sweet counsel together; / We walked with the throng in the house of God.
Let death surprise them; / May they go down into Sheol alive. / For evil is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
As for me, I call out to God, / And Jehovah will save me.
Evening and morning and at noontime / I complain and moan, / And He hears my voice.
He has redeemed my soul in peace / From the battle against me, / For many are they who strive with me.
God hears and answers them--/ Even He who sits enthroned from of old--Selah / Because with them there is no change, / And they do not fear God.
He put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; / He profaned his covenant.
Smooth were the buttery words of his mouth, / But his heart was war; / More soothing than oil were his words, / But they were in fact drawn swords.
Cast your burden upon Jehovah, / And He will sustain you; / He will never allow the righteous to be moved.
But You, O God, will bring them down / Into the pit of decay. / Men of bloodshed and deceit / Will not live out half their days; / But I will trust in You.
