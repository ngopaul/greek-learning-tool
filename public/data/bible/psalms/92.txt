It is good to give thanks to Jehovah / And to sing psalms to Your name, O Most High;
To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning / And Your faithfulness in the nights,
Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon a harp, / Upon the higgaion of the lyre.
For You have made me rejoice, O Jehovah, because of what You have done; / Because of the works of Your hands I will shout for joy.
How great are Your works, O Jehovah! / So very deep are Your thoughts!
A senseless man does not know them, / Nor does a fool understand them.
When the wicked sprout like grass, / And all the workers of iniquity blossom, / It is so that they may be destroyed forever.
But You are on high forever, O Jehovah.
For behold, Your enemies, O Jehovah; / For behold, Your enemies will perish; / All the workers of iniquity will be scattered.
But You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; / I am anointed with fresh oil.
And my eye has seen its desire for my enemies; / My ears have heard their desire for the evildoers who rise up against me.
The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree; / He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Planted in the house of Jehovah, / They will flourish in the courts of our God.
They will still bring forth fruit in old age; / They will be full of sap and green;
To declare that Jehovah is upright; / He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
