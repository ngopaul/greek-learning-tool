By the rivers of Babylon, / There we sat down; indeed, we wept / When we remembered Zion.
On the willows in the midst of it / We hung up our lyres,
For there our captors required of us songs, / And those who tormented us required of us mirth, saying, / Sing for us / One of the songs of Zion.
How can we sing the song of Jehovah / In a foreign land?
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, / Let my right hand forget its skill.
Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, / If I do not remember you, / If I do not prefer Jerusalem / Above my chief joy.
Remember, O Jehovah, / Against the children of Edom, / The day of Jerusalem, / Who said, Lay it bare! Lay it bare, / Down to its foundation!
O daughter of Babylon, who are to be devastated, / Happy will he be who repays you / The recompense of what you have rendered to us.
Happy will he be who seizes your little ones / And dashes them against the rock.
