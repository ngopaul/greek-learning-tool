When Jehovah turned again the captivity of Zion, / We were like those who dream.
At that time our mouth was filled with laughter / And our tongue with a ringing shout. / At that time they said among the nations, / Jehovah has done great things for them.
Jehovah has done great things for us; / We are joyful.
Turn again, O Jehovah, our captivity / Like the streams in the south.
Those who sow in tears / Will reap with a ringing shout.
He who goes forth and weeps, / Bearing seed for scattering, / Will no doubt come in with a ringing shout, / Bearing his sheaves with him.
