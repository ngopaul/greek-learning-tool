O Jehovah, who may sojourn in Your tent? / Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?
He who walks in integrity / And does righteousness / And speaks truth from his heart.
He does not slander with his tongue; / He does not do evil to his friend, / Nor does he take up a reproach against his neighbor.
In his eyes a reprobate is despised, / But he honors those who fear Jehovah. / Should he swear to his harm, / He does not change.
He does not lend his money on interest, / Nor accept a bribe against the innocent. / He who does these things will not be shaken forever.
