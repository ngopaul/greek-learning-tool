Ascribe to Jehovah, O sons of the Mighty, / Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength;
Ascribe to Jehovah the glory of His name; / Worship Jehovah in holy splendor.
The voice of Jehovah is over the waters; / The God of glory thunders, / Jehovah over the great waters.
The voice of Jehovah is powerful; / The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty.
The voice of Jehovah breaks the cedars; / Indeed Jehovah breaks the cedars of Lebanon in pieces;
And He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, / And Sirion like a young wild ox.
The voice of Jehovah cleaves out flames of fire.
The voice of Jehovah shakes the wilderness; / Jehovah shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of Jehovah causes the hinds to calve / And strips the forests bare; / And in His temple all say, Glory!
Jehovah sat enthroned at the Flood, / And Jehovah sits as King forever.
May Jehovah give strength to His people. / May Jehovah bless His people with peace.
