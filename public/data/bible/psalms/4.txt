When I call out, answer me, / O God of my righteousness; / Make room for me when I am in straits; / Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.
O sons of men, how long will my glory be made a reproach? / How long will you love vanity, will you seek a lie? Selah
But know that Jehovah sets apart the faithful man for Himself. / Jehovah hears when I call out to Him.
Be angry, yet do not sin; / Consider in your heart upon your bed, / And be silent. Selah
Offer sacrifices of righteousness, / And trust in Jehovah.
Many are those who say, Who will show us any good? / Lift up upon us the light of Your countenance, O Jehovah.
You have put joy in my heart, / More than when the grain and new wine of others abound.
In peace I will both lie down and sleep, / For You alone, O Jehovah, cause me to dwell in safety.
