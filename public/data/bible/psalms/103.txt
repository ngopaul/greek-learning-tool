Bless Jehovah, O my soul; / And all that is within me, bless His holy name.
Bless Jehovah, O my soul; / And do not forget all His benefits:
He pardons all your iniquities; / He heals all your diseases;
He redeems your life from the pit; / He crowns you with lovingkindness and compassions;
He satisfies the prime of your life with good, / So that your youth is renewed like the eagle.
Jehovah executes righteous acts, / And judgments for all who are oppressed.
He made His ways known to Moses; / His acts, to the children of Israel.
Jehovah is compassionate and gracious, / Long-suffering and abundant in lovingkindness.
He will not always contend with us, / Nor will He keep His anger forever.
He has not dealt with us according to our sins, / Nor has He recompensed us according to our iniquities.
For as high as the heavens are above the earth, / So great is His lovingkindness upon those who fear Him.
As far as the east is from the west, / So far has He removed our transgressions from us.
As compassionate as a father is toward his children, / So compassionate is Jehovah toward those who fear Him.
For He knows our frame; / He remembers that we are dust.
Man--his days are like grass; / He flourishes like a field flower:
For the wind passes over it, and it is no more; / And its own place knows of it no longer.
But Jehovah's lovingkindness is from eternity / Unto eternity upon those who fear Him, / And His righteousness is to the children's children;
To those who keep His covenant / And remember His precepts so as to do them.
Jehovah has established His throne in the heavens, / And His kingdom rules over all.
Bless Jehovah, you His angels, / Who are mighty in strength to perform His word, / By obeying the voice of His word.
Bless Jehovah, all you His hosts, / You His ministers who execute His will.
Bless Jehovah, all you His works, / In all places of His dominion. / Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
