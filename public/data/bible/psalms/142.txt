With my voice I cry to Jehovah; / With my voice I make my supplication to Jehovah.
I pour out my complaint before Him; / I declare my trouble before Him.
When my spirit fainted within me, / You knew my path. / On the way on which I walked / They have hidden a trap for me.
Look on my right hand and see, / For there is no one who regards me; / Refuge has failed me; / No one cares for me.
I cried to You, O Jehovah; / I said, You are my refuge, / My portion in the land of the living.
Give heed to my cry, / For I have been brought very low; / Deliver me from those who persecute me, / For they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, / That I may give thanks to Your name. / The righteous will surround me, / For You will deal bountifully with me.
