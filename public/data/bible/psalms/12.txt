Save, O Jehovah; for the faithful man is no more, / For the trustworthy have vanished from among the sons of men.
Each man speaks falsehood with his neighbor; / With flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
May Jehovah cut off all the flattering lips, / The tongue speaking great things,
Those who said, With our tongue we will prevail; / Our lips are our own: Who is our lord?
Because of the devastation of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, / I will now arise, says Jehovah; / I will set him in the safety that he longs for.
The words of Jehovah are pure words, / Silver refined in a furnace on the earth, / Purified seven times.
You, O Jehovah, will keep them; / You will guard them from this generation forever.
The wicked go about all around, / While vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
