Shout joyfully to God, all the earth;
Sing forth the glory of His name; / Make glorious His praise.
Say to God, How awesome are Your deeds! / Because of the greatness of Your strength, Your enemies come cringing to You.
All the earth will worship You / And sing psalms to You; / They will sing psalms to Your name. Selah
Come and see the works of God; / He is awesome in His deeds toward the sons of men.
He turned the sea into dry land; / Through the river they crossed on foot. / There we rejoiced in Him.
He rules by His might forever; / His eyes observe the nations: / Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah
Bless our God, O peoples; / And make the voice of His praise heard,
Who has kept our soul in life / And does not allow our feet to slip.
For You have tried us, O God; / You have refined us as silver is refined.
You have brought us into the net; / You have put a heavy burden on our loins.
You have made men ride over our heads; / We have gone through fire and water; / But You have brought us forth into abundance.
I will come into Your house with burnt offerings; / I will pay my vows to You,
Which my lips uttered / And my mouth spoke when I was in distress.
I will offer to You burnt offerings of fatlings / With the smoke of rams; / I will offer cattle with goats. Selah
Come, hear, all you who fear God, / And I will recount what He has done for my soul.
To Him I called out with my mouth, / And He was extolled with my tongue.
If I regarded iniquity in my heart, / The Lord did not hear.
But indeed God has heard; / He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed be God, / Who has not turned my prayer away / Nor His lovingkindness from me.
