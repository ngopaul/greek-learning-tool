O Jehovah, in Your strength the king rejoices, / And in Your salvation how greatly does he exult.
You have given him his heart's desire / And have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah
For You meet him with blessings of goodness; / You have set a crown of refined gold on his head.
He asked life of You; You granted it to him: / Length of days forever and ever.
His glory is great in Your salvation; / You have laid majesty and splendor upon him;
For You have made him to be blessings forever; / You have made him glad with rejoicing in Your presence.
For the king trusts in Jehovah; / And because of the lovingkindness of the Most High, he is not shaken.
Your hand finds all Your enemies; / Your right hand finds those who hate You.
You make them like a furnace of fire / When Your presence appears. / Jehovah swallows them in His anger, / And fire devours them.
You destroy their fruit from the earth, / And their seed from among the sons of men.
Although they intend evil against You, / And they think up a scheme, they will not prevail.
For You make them turn their back; / You aim with Your bowstrings at their faces.
Be exalted, O Jehovah, in Your strength; / We will sing and psalm Your might.
