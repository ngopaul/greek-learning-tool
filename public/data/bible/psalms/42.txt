As the hart pants / After the streams of water, / So my soul pants / For You, O God.
My soul thirsts for God, / For the living God. / When will I come and appear / Before God?
My tears have been my food / Day and night, / While they say to me all day long, / Where is your God?
These things I remember, / And I pour out my soul within me: / That I passed through with the throng; / I led them to the house of God / With the voice of a joyous shout and praise, / The festal multitude.
Why are you cast down, O my soul? / And why are you disquieted within me? / Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him / For the salvation of His countenance.
O my God, my soul is cast down within me; / Therefore I remember You / From the land of the Jordan and the Hermons, / From Mount Mizar.
Deep calls unto deep / At the sound of Your water spouts; / All Your waves and Your billows / Pass over me.
By day Jehovah commands / His lovingkindness, / And by night His song is with me, / A prayer to the God of my life.
I say to God my rock, / Why have You forgotten me? / Why do I go mourning / Because of the oppression of the enemy?
As with a shattering in my bones, / My adversaries reproach me, / While they say to me all day long, / Where is your God?
Why are you cast down, O my soul? / And why are you disquieted within me? / Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, / The salvation of my countenance and my God.
