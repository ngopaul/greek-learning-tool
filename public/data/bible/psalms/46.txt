God is our refuge and strength; / A help in distress, He is most readily found.
Therefore we will not fear, / Though the earth change, / And the mountains slip into the heart of the seas;
Though the waters of the sea roar and foam; / Though the mountains shake at its swelling. Selah
There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God, / The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
God is in the midst of her; she will not be moved; / God helps her at the dawn of the morning.
The nations rage; the kingdoms are moved. / He utters His voice; the earth melts.
Jehovah of hosts is with us; / The God of Jacob is our high retreat. Selah
Come, see the works of Jehovah, / How He has made desolations on earth.
He makes wars cease unto the end of the earth; / He breaks the bow and cuts the spear to pieces; / He burns the war wagons with fire.
Be still and know that I am God. / I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted on earth.
Jehovah of hosts is with us; / The God of Jacob is our high retreat. Selah
