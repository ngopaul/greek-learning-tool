Blessed is the man / Who does not walk / In the counsel of the wicked, / Nor stand on the path of sinners, / Nor sit in the seat of mockers;
Rather his delight is in the law of Jehovah, / And in His law he meditates by day and by night.
And he will be like a tree / Transplanted beside streams of water, / Which yields its fruit in its season, / And whose foliage does not wither; / And everything he does prospers.
The wicked are not so, / But are like chaff, / Which the wind drives away.
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment; / Nor the sinners, in the assembly of the righteous.
For Jehovah knows the way of the righteous, / But the way of the wicked will perish.
