I will sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah forever; / From generation to generation I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth.
For I have said, Lovingkindness will be built up forever; / In the heavens themselves You will establish Your faithfulness.
I have made a covenant with My chosen one; / I have sworn to David My servant:
I will establish your seed forever, / And I will build up your throne from generation to generation. Selah
And the heavens will praise Your wonders, O Jehovah, / Indeed Your faithfulness in the congregation of the holy ones.
For who in the skies can be compared to Jehovah? / Who among the sons of the mighty is like Jehovah,
Like God, greatly feared in the council of the holy ones / And awesome beyond all around Him?
O Jehovah God of hosts, who is like You, the mighty Jah? / Your faithfulness also surrounds You.
You rule the swelling of the sea: / When its waves rise up, You still them.
You crushed Rahab like one slain; / You scattered Your enemies with the arm of Your strength.
The heavens are Yours; the earth also is Yours; / The world and its fullness You have founded.
You created the north and the south; / Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name.
You have an arm with might; / Your hand is strong; Your right hand is high.
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; / Lovingkindness and truth go before Your face.
Blessed are the people who know the joyful shout; / They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of Your countenance.
In Your name they exult all day long, / And in Your righteousness they are exalted.
For You are the glory of their strength, / And in Your favor our horn is exalted.
For our shield belongs to Jehovah, / And our king, to the Holy One of Israel.
Then You spoke in vision / Of Your Holy One, and You said, / I have given help to One who is mighty; / I have exalted One chosen from My people.
I have found David My Servant; / With My holy oil I have anointed Him,
With whom My hand will be established; / My arm will also strengthen Him.
The enemy will not exact anything from Him, / Nor will the son of wickedness afflict Him.
And I will crush His adversaries before Him, / And I will strike those who hate Him.
And My faithfulness and My lovingkindness will be with Him, / And in My name His horn will be exalted.
And I will set His hand on the sea / And His right hand on the rivers.
He will call upon Me, saying, You are My Father, / My God and the rock of My salvation.
I will also make Him the Firstborn, / The highest of the kings of the earth.
I will keep My lovingkindness for Him forever, / And My covenant will stand firm with Him.
And I will establish His seed forever, / And His throne as the days of heaven.
If His children forsake My law / And do not walk in My ordinances,
If they profane My statutes / And do not keep My commandments,
I will punish their transgression with a rod / And their iniquity with stripes.
But My lovingkindness I will not utterly take away from Him, / Nor will I be false to My own faithfulness.
I will not profane My covenant, / Nor will I change what has gone forth from My lips.
Once I have sworn by My holiness; / I will not lie to David.
His seed shall endure forever, / And His throne, like the sun before Me;
It shall be established forever like the moon; / And the witness in the skies is firm. Selah
But You have cast off and rejected; / You have been angry with Your anointed.
You have abhorred the covenant of Your servant; / You have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
You have broken down all his walls; / You have brought his strongholds to ruin.
All who pass by on the way plunder him; / He has become a reproach to his neighbors.
You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries; / You have caused all his enemies to rejoice.
Indeed You have turned back the edge of his sword / And have not made him stand in the battle.
You have made his brightness cease / And have cast down his throne to the ground.
You have shortened the days of his youth; / You have covered him with shame. Selah
How long, O Jehovah? Will You hide Yourself forever? / How long will Your wrath burn like fire?
Remember how short my time is--/ For what vanity You have created all the sons of men!
What man will live and not see death? / Will he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah
Where are Your former acts of lovingkindness, O Lord, / Which You swore to David in Your faithfulness?
Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, / How I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty peoples,
With which Your enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, / With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed.
Blessed be Jehovah forever. / Amen and Amen.
