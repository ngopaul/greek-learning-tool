Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, / For His lovingkindness is forever.
Let Israel say, / His lovingkindness is forever.
Let the house of Aaron say, / His lovingkindness is forever.
Let those who fear Jehovah say, / His lovingkindness is forever.
Out of my distress I called upon Jehovah; / Jehovah answered me and set me in a place broad and free.
Jehovah is for me; I will not be afraid. / What can man do to me?
Jehovah is for me as my Helper, / And I will see what should happen to those who hate me.
It is better to take refuge in Jehovah / Than to trust in man.
It is better to take refuge in Jehovah / Than to trust in princes.
All nations surrounded me; / In the name of Jehovah I indeed cut them down!
They surrounded me; yes, they surrounded me; / In the name of Jehovah I indeed cut them down!
They surrounded me like bees; / They were extinguished like a fire of thorns; / In the name of Jehovah I indeed cut them down!
I was pushed hard that I might fall; / But Jehovah helped me.
Jehovah is my strength and my song, / And He has become my salvation.
The voice of rejoicing and salvation / Is in the tents of the righteous. / The right hand of Jehovah does valiantly;
The right hand of Jehovah is exalted; / The right hand of Jehovah does valiantly.
I will not die, but live, / And declare the works of Jehovah.
Jehovah has severely chastened me, / But He has not given me over to death.
Open to me the gates of righteousness: / I will enter in through them; I will give thanks to Jehovah.
This is the gate of Jehovah; / The righteous shall enter in through it.
I will give thanks to You, for You have answered me / And have become my salvation.
The stone which the builders rejected / Has become the head of the corner.
This is from Jehovah; / It is wonderful in our sight.
This is the day that Jehovah has made; / Let us exult and rejoice in it.
O Jehovah, do save, we pray! / O Jehovah, do send prosperity, we pray!
Blessed is He who comes in the name of Jehovah; / We bless you from the house of Jehovah.
Jehovah is God, / And He has given us light; / Bind the sacrifice of the feast with cords / To the horns of the altar.
You are my God, and I give thanks to You. / You are my God; I will exalt You.
Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, / For His lovingkindness is forever.
