My heart overflows with a good matter; / I speak what I have composed concerning the King. / My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
You are fairer than the sons of men; / Grace is poured upon Your lips; / Therefore God has blessed You forever.
Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O mighty One, / In Your majesty and Your splendor.
And in Your splendor ride on victoriously / Because of truth and meekness and righteousness; / And let Your right hand teach You awesome deeds.
Your arrows are sharp: / The peoples fall under You; / The arrows are in the heart of the King's enemies.
Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; / The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.
You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; / Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You / With the oil of gladness above Your companions.
All Your garments smell of myrrh and aloes, of cassia; / From palaces of ivory, harpstrings have made You glad.
The daughters of kings are among Your most prized; / The queen stands at Your right hand in the gold of Ophir.
Hear, O daughter, and see; and incline your ear; / And forget your people and your father's house;
Thus the King will desire your beauty. / Because He is your Lord, / Worship Him.
And the daughter of Tyre will come with a gift; / The rich among the people will entreat your favor.
The king's daughter is all glorious within the royal abode; / Her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold.
She will be led to the King in embroidered clothing; / The virgins behind her, her companions, / Will be brought to You.
They will be led with rejoicing and exultation; / They will enter the King's palace.
In the place of Your fathers will be Your sons; / You will make them princes in all the earth.
I will cause Your name to be remembered in all generations; / Therefore the peoples will praise You forever and ever.
