Hallelujah! / Praise Jehovah, O my soul!
I will praise Jehovah while I live; / I will sing psalms to my God while I yet have being.
Do not trust in princes, / In a son of man, with whom there is no salvation.
His breath goes forth; he returns to his earth; / On that day his plans perish.
Blessed is the man whose help is the God of Jacob, / Whose hope is in Jehovah his God,
Who made heaven and earth / And the sea, and all that is in them; / Who keeps faith forever;
Who executes judgment for the oppressed; / Who gives food to the famished. / Jehovah frees the prisoners;
Jehovah opens the eyes of the blind; / Jehovah raises up those who are bowed down; / Jehovah loves the righteous;
Jehovah preserves the sojourners; / He upholds the orphan and the widow; / But He subverts the way of the wicked.
Jehovah will reign forever, / Your God, O Zion, forever and ever. / Hallelujah!
