Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness; / According to the greatness of Your compassions blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, / And from my sin cleanse me.
For I do know my transgressions, / And my sin is before me continually.
Against You and You alone have I sinned, / And I have done what is evil in Your sight. / Therefore You are righteous when You speak; / You are clear when You judge.
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, / And in sin did my mother conceive me.
Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts; / And in the hidden part You would make known wisdom to me.
Purge my sin with hyssop, and I will be clean; / Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
Let me hear gladness and joy, / That the bones which You have broken may exult.
Hide Your face from my sins, / And blot out all my iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, / And renew a steadfast spirit within me.
Do not cast me from Your presence, / And do not take the Spirit of Your holiness away from me.
Restore to me the gladness of Your salvation, / And sustain me with a willing spirit.
I will teach transgressors Your ways, / And sinners will turn back to You.
Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, O God of my salvation; / And my tongue will ring forth Your righteousness.
O Lord, open my lips, / And my mouth will declare Your praise.
For You do not delight in sacrifice; / Otherwise I would offer it; / You take no pleasure in burnt offerings.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; / A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.
Do good in Your good pleasure unto Zion; / Build the walls of Jerusalem.
Then You will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, / In burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; / Then they will offer bulls upon Your altar.
