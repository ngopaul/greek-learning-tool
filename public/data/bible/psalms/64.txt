Hear, O God, my voice in my complaint; / Preserve my life from the enemy's dread.
Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, / From the throng of the workers of iniquity,
Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword, / Who have aimed their arrow, their bitter word,
To shoot in secret places at the perfect man. / They shoot suddenly at him and do not fear.
They firm up for themselves an evil matter; / They talk of laying snares secretly; / They say, Who will see them?
They seek out injustices, saying: / We have completed a carefully sought-out plan. / Indeed each man's inward thought / And heart are deep.
But God will shoot an arrow at them; / Suddenly they are wounded.
They are made to stumble over each other by their own tongue; / All who see them shake their heads.
And all men will fear / And declare what has been done by God, / And they will ponder His work.
The righteous man will rejoice in Jehovah and take refuge in Him, / And all the upright in heart will boast.
