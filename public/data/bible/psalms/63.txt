O God, You are my God; I seek You diligently. / My soul thirsts for You, / My flesh faints in longing for You, / In a dry and weary land without water.
So I have looked upon You in the sanctuary, / Seeing Your power and Your glory.
Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, / My lips praise You.
Thus I bless You while I live; / I lift up my hands in Your name.
My soul is satisfied as with the rich fatness, / And my mouth praises You with lips of joyous shouting,
When I remember You while on my bed, / When I consider You in the night watches.
For You have been my help, / And in the shadow of Your wings I will shout for joy.
My soul pursues after You; / Your right hand upholds me.
But those who seek my life to destroy it / Will go into the lower parts of the earth;
They will be given over to the power of the sword; / They will be the portion of foxes.
But the king will rejoice in God; / Everyone who swears by Him will boast; / For the mouth of those who speak falsehood will be stopped.
