O God, do not keep silent; / Do not be quiet, and do not be still, O God.
For, behold, Your enemies are in tumult, / And those who hate You lift up their heads.
They devise crafty counsel against Your people, / And conspire against Your hidden ones.
They have said, Come and let us destroy them from being a nation, / That the name of Israel may no longer be remembered.
For they have conspired together with one heart; / It is against You that they have made an alliance:
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, / Moab and the Hagarites,
Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, / Philistia along with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Assyria is also joined with them; / They have been a help to the children of Lot. Selah
Do with them as with Midian, / As with Sisera and Jabin, at the brook Kishon:
They were destroyed at Endor; / They became dung for the earth.
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, / And all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
Who said, Let us possess for ourselves / The habitations of God.
O my God, make them like a tumbleweed, / Like stubble before the wind.
Like fire that burns a forest / And like a flame that sets mountains on fire,
So pursue them with Your tempest, / And terrify them with Your storm.
Fill their faces with shame, / That they may seek Your name, O Jehovah.
May they be ashamed and dismayed forever, / And may they be confounded and perish;
That they may know that You alone, whose name is Jehovah, / Are the Most High over all the earth.
