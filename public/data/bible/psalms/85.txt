You have been pleased, O Jehovah, with Your land; / You have turned the captivity of Jacob.
You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people; / You have covered all their sin. Selah
You have taken away all Your wrath; / You have turned from the fierceness of Your anger.
Restore us, O God of our salvation, / And cause Your indignation toward us to cease.
Will You be angry with us forever? / Will You extend Your anger from generation to generation?
Will You not again revive us, / That Your people may rejoice in You?
Show us, O Jehovah, Your lovingkindness, / And grant us Your salvation.
I will hear what God Jehovah will speak, / For He will speak peace / To His people and to His faithful ones; / But let them not turn again unto folly.
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, / That glory may dwell in our land.
Lovingkindness and truth have met together; / Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Truth has sprung forth from the earth, / And righteousness has looked down from heaven.
Indeed Jehovah will give what is good, / And our land will give its increase.
Righteousness will go before Him / And make His footsteps a way to walk in.
