Hallelujah! / Sing a new song to Jehovah; / Sing His praise in the congregation of His faithful ones.
Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; / Let the children of Zion exult in their King.
Let them praise His name with dancing; / Let them sing psalms to Him with the tambourine and the lyre.
For Jehovah takes pleasure in His people; / He adorns the lowly with salvation.
Let the faithful ones exult in glory; / Let them give a ringing shout upon their beds.
Let the high praises of God be in their throats, / And a two-edged sword in their hand,
To execute vengeance on the nations / And punishment among the peoples;
To bind their kings with fetters / And their nobles with chains of iron;
To execute upon them the judgment written. / This honor is for all His faithful ones. / Hallelujah!
