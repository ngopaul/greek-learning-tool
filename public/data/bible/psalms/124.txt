If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, / Let Israel say,
If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side / When men rose up against us;
Then they would have swallowed us up alive / When their anger burned against us;
Then the waters would have washed us away; / The stream would have passed over our soul;
Then the proud waters / Would have passed over our soul.
Blessed be Jehovah, who has not given us / As prey to their teeth.
Our soul has escaped like a bird, / Out of the snare of the fowlers; / The snare is broken, / And we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of Jehovah, / Who made heaven and earth.
