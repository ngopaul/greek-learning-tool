O Jehovah, do not rebuke me in Your anger, / Nor chasten me in Your burning wrath.
Be gracious to me, O Jehovah, for I am languishing; / Heal me, O Jehovah, for my bones are shaken,
And my soul is greatly shaken. / But as for You, O Jehovah, how long?
Return, O Jehovah; deliver my soul; / Save me for Your lovingkindness' sake.
For in death there is no remembrance of You; / In Sheol who can give thanks to You?
I am weary with my groaning; / Every night I cause my bed to swim; / With my tears I dissolve my couch.
My eye is wasted because of grief; / It has aged because of all those who vex me.
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, / For Jehovah has heard the sound of my weeping.
Jehovah has heard my supplication; / Jehovah receives my prayer.
All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly dismayed; / They will turn back; they will be put to shame suddenly.
