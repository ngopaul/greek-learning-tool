The fool has said in his heart, / There is no God. / They are corrupt; they commit abominable deeds; / There is none who does good.
Jehovah looked down from heaven / Upon the sons of men / To see if there was anyone who had insight, / Who seeks after God.
They have all turned aside; / They are together perverse. / There is none who does good; / There is not even one.
Have they no knowledge, all the workers of iniquity, / Who eat up my people as they would eat up bread / And do not call upon Jehovah?
There they were in great fear, / For God is among the generation of the righteous.
You put the counsel of the afflicted to shame, / But Jehovah is their refuge.
Oh that the salvation of Israel might come forth from Zion! / When Jehovah turns the captivity of His people, / Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice.
