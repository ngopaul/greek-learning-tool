O Jehovah, do not rebuke me in Your indignation, / Nor chasten me in Your burning wrath.
For Your arrows have sunk deep in me, / And Your hand has come down heavy upon me.
There is no soundness in my flesh due to Your indignation; / There is no wholeness in my bones due to my sin.
For my iniquities have passed over my head; / Like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
My wounds are odious and festering / Due to my foolishness.
I am bent down and bowed utterly; / I go about all day long mourning.
For my loins are filled with burning, / And there is no soundness in my flesh.
I am benumbed and crushed utterly; / I cry out due to the groaning of my heart.
O Lord, all my desire is before You, / And my groaning is not hidden from You.
My heart throbs; my strength fails me; / And as for the light of my eyes, neither is it with me.
Those who love me and those who are my friends stand aloof from my plague, / And my relatives stand far away.
And those who seek my soul lay traps for me, / And those who pursue my misfortune speak of destruction, / And they contemplate deceit all day long.
But I, like a deaf man, cannot hear; / And I am like a dumb man, who cannot open his mouth.
Indeed I am like a man who does not hear / And in whose mouth there are no reproofs.
For in You, O Jehovah, do I hope; / You will respond, O Lord my God.
For I said, May they never rejoice over me! / When my foot slips, they magnify themselves over me.
For I am ready to stumble, / And my pain is before me continually.
For I declare my iniquity; / I am anxious because of my sin.
But my enemies are vigorous; they are strong; / And those who wrongly hate me are many.
Those also who repay evil for good / Are my adversaries because I pursue what is good.
Do not abandon me, O Jehovah; / O my God, do not be far away from me.
Hasten to help me, / O Lord, my salvation.
