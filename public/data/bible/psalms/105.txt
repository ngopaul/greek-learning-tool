Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name; / Make known His deeds among the peoples.
Sing to Him; sing psalms to Him; / Muse upon all His wondrous deeds.
Glory in His holy name; / Let the heart of those who seek Jehovah rejoice.
Seek Jehovah and His strength; / Seek His face continually.
Remember His wondrous deeds, which He has done, / His signs and the judgments of His mouth,
O seed of Abraham His servant, / O children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
He is Jehovah our God; / His judgments are in all the earth.
He has remembered His covenant forever, / The word that He commanded to a thousand generations,
The covenant that He made with Abraham, / And His oath unto Isaac.
And He confirmed it unto Jacob as a statute, / Unto Israel as an eternal covenant,
Saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan, / The portion of your inheritance;
When they were men few in number, / Indeed very few and strangers in the land.
And they went about from nation to nation, / From one kingdom to another people.
He allowed no man to oppress them; / Indeed He rebuked kings for their sake.
Saying, Do not touch My anointed ones, / And do My prophets no harm.
And He called a famine upon the land; / He broke the whole staff of bread.
He sent a man before them; / Joseph was sold as a servant.
They afflicted his feet with fetters; / He himself was placed in irons.
Until the time when his word came to pass, / The word of Jehovah tried him.
The king sent men and freed him, / Even the ruler of the peoples, and let him go.
He made him lord of his house / And ruler over all his possessions,
To imprison his princes at will, / And to teach his elders wisdom.
Then Israel came into Egypt, / And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
And He made His people very fruitful, / And caused them to be mightier than their adversaries.
He turned their heart to hate His people, / To deal craftily with His servants.
He sent Moses His servant, / And Aaron, whom He had chosen.
They set His signs among them, / And wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness and made it dark; / And they did not rebel against His words.
He turned their waters into blood, / And killed their fish.
Their land teemed with frogs, / Even in the chambers of their kings.
He spoke, and a swarm of flies came; / There were lice within all their borders.
He gave them hail for rain, / And flaming fire in their land.
He struck their vines and their fig trees, / And He broke the trees of their borders.
He spoke, and the swarming locusts came, / And the licking locusts, even without number.
And they ate every herb in their land, / And they ate the fruit of their ground.
He struck all the firstborn in their land, / The firstfruits of all their vigor.
And He brought them out with silver and gold, / And there was none among His tribes who stumbled.
Egypt rejoiced at their going forth, / For a dread of them had fallen upon them.
He spread a cloud for a covering, / And a fire to give light by night.
They asked, and He brought quails; / And He satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock, and water gushed forth; / It ran in the dry places like a river.
For He remembered His holy word / And Abraham His servant.
And He brought forth His people with gladness, / His chosen ones with a ringing shout.
And He gave them the lands of the nations, / And they took possession of the labor of the peoples,
So that they might keep His statutes / And observe His laws. / Hallelujah.
