To You do I lift up my eyes, / You who sit enthroned in heaven.
Behold, as the eyes of the servants / Look to the hand of their masters, / As the eyes of a servant girl / Look to the hand of her mistress, / So our eyes look to Jehovah our God, / Until He is gracious to us.
Be gracious to us, O Jehovah, be gracious to us; / For we are greatly filled with contempt.
Our soul is greatly filled / With the scorn of those who are at ease, / With the contempt of the proud.
