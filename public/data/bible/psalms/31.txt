In You, O Jehovah, do I take refuge; / Never let me be put to shame. / Rescue me in Your righteousness.
Incline Your ear to me; / Deliver me speedily. / Be to me a rock of protection, / A fortress, to save me.
For You are my crag and my fortress; / Therefore for Your name's sake / Lead me and guide me.
Bring me out of the net / That they have secretly laid for me, / For You are my protection.
Into Your hand I commit my spirit; / Redeem me, O Jehovah, God of truth.
I hate those who regard vanities of falsehood, / But I trust in Jehovah.
I will exult and rejoice in Your lovingkindness, / Since You have seen my affliction; / You know the distress of my soul.
And You have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; / You have made my feet stand in a place broad and free.
Be gracious to me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress. / My eye is wasted away with grief, / Indeed my soul and body.
For my life has been consumed in sorrow, / And my years, in sighing. / My strength fails because of my iniquity, / And my bones have wasted away.
Because of all my adversaries, / I have become a reproach, / And especially so to my neighbors, / And something dreaded to my acquaintances; / Those who see me on the street flee from me.
I am forgotten, like a dead man out of mind; / I am like a destroyed vessel.
For I hear the slander of many; / Terror is on every side. / When they take counsel together against me, / They scheme to take my life.
But I trust in You, O Jehovah; / I say, You are my God.
My times are in Your hand; / Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who pursue me.
Cause Your face to shine upon Your servant; / Save me in Your lovingkindness.
O Jehovah, do not let me be put to shame when I call out to You; / Let the wicked be put to shame; let them be silent in Sheol.
Let the lips of falsehood be made dumb, / Which speak arrogantly against the righteous / With pride and contempt.
How great is Your goodness, / Which You have stored up for those who fear You, / Which You have accomplished in the sight of the sons of men / For those who take refuge in You!
You hide them in the hiding place of Your presence / Apart from the conspiracies of men; / You lay them away secretly in a shelter / Apart from the contention of tongues.
Blessed be Jehovah, / For He displayed His lovingkindness wondrously / To me in a fortified city.
I, on my part, had said in my alarm, / I am cut off before Your eyes; / But instead You heard / The voice of my supplications / When I cried out to You.
Love Jehovah, all you who are His faithful ones; / Jehovah guards the trustworthy, / And recompenses abundantly / Him who acts haughtily.
Be strong, and let your heart be encouraged, / All you who hope in Jehovah.
