Judge me, O Jehovah; / For I have walked in my integrity, / And in Jehovah I have trusted; / I will not waver.
Examine me, O Jehovah, and try me; / Test my inward parts and my heart.
For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes, / And I have walked in Your truth.
I do not sit with men of falsehood, / Nor will I associate with hypocrites.
I hate the assembly of evildoers, / Nor will I sit with the wicked.
I wash my hands in innocence / And go around Your altar, O Jehovah,
Making myself heard with the voice of thanksgiving / And telling out all Your wonderful deeds.
O Jehovah, I love the habitation of Your house, / And the place where Your glory abides.
Do not gather my soul with sinners, / Nor my life with men of bloodshed,
In whose hand is a wicked scheme, / And whose right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I walk in my integrity; / Redeem me and be gracious to me.
My foot stands on level ground; / In the assemblies I will bless Jehovah.
