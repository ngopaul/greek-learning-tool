I will extol You, O my God and King; / And I will bless Your name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You, / And I will praise Your name forever and ever.
Great is Jehovah, and much to be praised; / And His greatness is unsearchable.
One generation will laud Your works to another, / And they will declare Your mighty acts.
Upon the glorious splendor of Your majesty / And upon Your wondrous works I will muse.
And men will speak of the might of Your awesome deeds, / And I will declare Your greatness.
They will utter the memory of Your great goodness / And will sing for joy of Your righteousness.
Jehovah is gracious and compassionate, / Long-suffering and great in lovingkindness.
Jehovah is good to all, / And His compassions are upon all His works.
All Your works will praise You, O Jehovah; / And Your faithful ones will bless You.
They will speak of the glory of Your kingdom / And tell of Your power,
To make known to the sons of men Your mighty acts / And the glorious splendor of Your kingdom.
Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom, / And Your dominion is throughout all generations.
Jehovah upholds all who are falling / And raises up all who are bowed down.
The eyes of everyone wait for You, / And You give them their food in due season.
You open up Your hand / And satisfy the desire of every living thing.
Jehovah is righteous in all His ways, / And faithfully kind in all His doings.
Jehovah is near to all who call upon Him, / To all who call upon Him in truth.
He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him, / And He will hear their cry and save them.
Jehovah preserves all who love Him, / But He will destroy all the wicked.
My mouth will speak the praise of Jehovah, / And all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever.
