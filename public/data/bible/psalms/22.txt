My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? / Why are You so far from saving me, / From the words of my groaning?
O my God, I call out in the day, but You do not answer; / And in the night, but there is no rest for me.
But You are holy, You who sit enthroned / Upon the praises of Israel.
In You our fathers trusted; / They trusted and You rescued them.
To You they cried out and were delivered; / In You they trusted and were not put to shame.
But I am a worm and not a man, / A reproach of men and one despised by the people.
All who see me deride me; / They sneer at me; they shake their heads, saying,
He committed himself to Jehovah; let Him rescue him; / Let Him deliver him since He takes pleasure in him.
But You are the One who drew me forth from the womb, / Who made me trust while at my mother's breasts.
I was cast upon You from birth; / From my mother's womb You have been my God.
Do not be far from me, / For trouble is near, / For there is none to help me.
Many bulls surround me; / The mighty bulls of Bashan encompass me.
They open their mouth at me, / Like a ravening and roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, / And all my bones are out of joint. / My heart is like wax; / It is melted within me.
My strength is dried up like a shard, / And my tongue is stuck to my jaws; / You have put me in the dust of death.
For dogs surround me; / A company of evildoers encloses me; / They pierce my hands and feet.
I count all my bones; / They look, they stare at me.
They divide my garments to themselves, / And for my clothing they cast lots.
But You, O Jehovah, be not far off; / O my help, hasten to aid me.
Deliver my soul from the sword, / My precious life from the power of the dog;
Save me from the mouth of the lion; / Indeed while I am in the horns of wild oxen, answer me.
I will declare Your name to my brothers; / In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.
You who fear Jehovah, praise Him! / All you seed of Jacob, glorify Him! / And stand in awe of Him, all you seed of Israel!
For He has not despised nor detested / The affliction of him who is afflicted; / And He has not hidden His face from him; / But when he cried out to Him, He heard.
From You comes my praise in the great assembly; / My vows will I pay before those who fear Him.
The lowly will eat and be satisfied; / Those who seek after Jehovah will praise Him--/ May your hearts live forever!
All the ends of the earth / Will remember and return to Jehovah, / And all families of the nations / Will worship before You;
For the kingdom is Jehovah's, / And He rules among the nations.
All the flourishing of the earth / Will eat and worship. / All who go down into the dust will bow down before Him, / Even he who does not keep his soul alive.
A seed will serve Him; / That which concerns the Lord will be told to a coming generation.
They will come and declare His righteousness / To a people yet to be born, that He has done this.
