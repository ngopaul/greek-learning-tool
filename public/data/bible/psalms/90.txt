O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.
Before the mountains were brought forth, / And before You gave birth to the earth and the world, / Indeed from eternity to eternity, You are God.
You return man to dust / And say, Return, you sons of men.
For a thousand years in Your sight / Are like yesterday when it passes by / And like a watch in the night.
You sweep them away as with a rain flood; they are as in a sleep: / In the morning they are like grass that comes up anew.
In the morning it flourishes and comes up anew; / In the evening it is cut down, and it dries up.
For we have been consumed by Your anger, / And by Your wrath we have been troubled.
You have set our iniquities before You, / Our secret sins in the light of Your countenance.
For all our days have passed away in Your overflowing wrath; / We bring our years to an end like a sigh.
The days of our years are seventy years, / Or, if because of strength, eighty years; / But their pride is labor and sorrow, / For it is soon gone, and we fly away.
Who knows the power of Your anger, / And Your overflowing wrath according to the fear that is due You?
Teach us then to number our days / That we may gain a heart of wisdom.
Return, O Jehovah! How long? / And repent concerning Your servants.
Satisfy us in the morning with Your lovingkindness / That we may give a ringing shout and rejoice all our days.
Cause us to rejoice according to the days that You have afflicted us, / According to the years that we have seen evil.
Let Your work appear to Your servants, / And Your splendor, to their children.
And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, / And establish the work of our hands upon us; / Indeed the work of our hands, establish it.
