Hallelujah! / I will give thanks to Jehovah with all my heart / In the council of the upright and in the assembly.
Great are the works of Jehovah, / And sought out by all who delight in them.
His work is majesty and splendor, / And His righteousness endures forever.
He has caused His wondrous deeds to be remembered; / Jehovah is gracious and compassionate.
He gives food to those who fear Him; / He remembers His covenant forever.
He has shown His people the power of His works / By giving them the heritage of the nations.
The works of His hands are truth and justice; / All His precepts are sure:
They are maintained forever and ever, / They are executed in truth and uprightness.
He has sent redemption to His people; / He has commanded His covenant forever; / Holy and awesome is His name.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; / All who practice His precepts have a good understanding. / His praise endures forever.
