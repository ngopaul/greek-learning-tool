Hear, O God, my cry; / Give heed to my prayer.
From the end of the earth / I will call out unto You / When my heart faints; / Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
For You are a refuge to me, / A strong tower before the enemy.
Let me sojourn in Your tent forever; / Let me take refuge in the covering of Your wings. Selah
For You, O God, have heard my vows; / You have given me the inheritance of those who fear Your name.
You will add days to the days of the king; / May his years be like generation after generation.
May he dwell forever before God; / Appoint lovingkindness and faithfulness, that they may preserve him.
So I will sing psalms to Your name forever, / As I repay my vows day by day.
