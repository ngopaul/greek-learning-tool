Blessed be Jehovah my rock, / Who teaches my hands for war / And my fingers for battle:
My Lord of lovingkindness and my fortress, / My high retreat and my Deliverer, / My shield and He in whom I take refuge, / Who subdues my people under me.
O Jehovah, what is man, that You take knowledge of him, / And the son of mortal man, that You think of him?
Man is like a breath; / His days are like a passing shadow.
O Jehovah, bow Your heavens down and descend; / Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.
Flash forth lightning, and scatter them; / Send forth Your arrows, and discomfit them.
Stretch forth Your hand from on high; / Rescue me and deliver me / From the great waters, / From the hand of foreigners,
Whose mouth speaks deceit, / And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
O God, I will sing a new song to You; / Upon a harp of ten strings I will sing psalms to You,
Who gives salvation to kings, / Who rescues David His servant from the hurtful sword.
Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, / Whose mouth speaks deceit, / And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
May our sons be like plants / Grown up in their youth; / May our daughters be like corner pillars / Hewn out in fashion for a palace;
May our barns be full, / Furnishing produce of all kinds; / May our sheep bring forth thousands / And ten thousands in our fields;
May our oxen be fully laden; / May there be no breaking in to rob or going forth to fight, / Or outcry in our streets.
Blessed are the people who are so; / Blessed are the people whose God is Jehovah.
