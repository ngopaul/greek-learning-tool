Sing to Jehovah a new song; / Sing to Jehovah, all the earth.
Sing to Jehovah, bless His name; / Proclaim His salvation from day to day.
Declare His glory among the nations, / His wondrous deeds among all the peoples.
For Jehovah is great and much to be praised; / He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols, / But Jehovah made the heavens.
Majesty and splendor are before Him; / Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.
Ascribe to Jehovah, O families of the peoples, / Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength;
Ascribe to Jehovah the glory of His name; / Bring an offering, and come into His courts.
Worship Jehovah in holy splendor; / Tremble before Him, all the earth.
Say among the nations, Jehovah reigns; / Indeed the world has been established; it will not be moved; / He will judge the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be glad; / Let the sea and its fullness roar.
Let the field and all that is in it exult; / Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy
Before Jehovah, for He is coming; / For He is coming to judge the earth; / He will judge the world with righteousness, / And the peoples with His truth.
