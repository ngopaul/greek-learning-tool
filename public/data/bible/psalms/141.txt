O Jehovah, I have called upon You; hasten to me. / Give ear to my voice when I call out to You.
Let my prayer be set before You as incense, / The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.
Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth; / Keep the door of my lips.
Do not let my heart turn to anything evil, / To practice deeds of wickedness / With men who commit iniquity; / And let me not eat of their delicacies.
Let the righteous strike me in kindness and reprove me; / Let not my head refuse oil upon the head, / For still my prayer is against their evil deeds.
Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock, / And they hear my words, that they are pleasant.
As when one plows and breaks up the earth, / Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
For my eyes are upon You, O Jehovah Lord; / In You I take refuge; do not pour out my soul.
Keep me from the trap they have set for me / And from the snares of the workers of iniquity.
May the wicked fall into their own nets / While I alone pass by.
