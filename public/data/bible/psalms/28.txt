To You, O Jehovah, do I call out; / My rock, do not be deaf to me, / Lest, if You are silent to me, / I become like those who go down into the pit.
Hear the voice of my supplications / When I cry out to You, / When I lift up my hands / Unto Your innermost sanctuary.
Do not drag me away with the wicked / And with the workers of iniquity, / Who speak peace to their neighbors / While evil is in their heart.
Repay them according to what they have done / And according to the evil of their deeds; / According to the work of their hands repay them; / Return to them their due.
For they do not regard the acts of Jehovah / Or the work of His hands; / He will tear them down / And not rebuild them.
Blessed be Jehovah, / For He has heard the voice of my supplications.
Jehovah is my strength and my shield; / My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; / Therefore my heart exults; / And with my song do I give thanks to Him.
Jehovah is their strength; / And He is a stronghold of salvation to His anointed.
Save Your people, / And bless Your inheritance; / And shepherd them and carry them forever.
