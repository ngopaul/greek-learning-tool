To You, O Jehovah, / I lift up my soul.
O my God, I trust in You; / Do not let me be ashamed; / Do not let my enemies exult over me.
Indeed may all who wait on You not be ashamed; / May those who deal treacherously without cause be ashamed.
Make Your ways known to me, O Jehovah; / Teach me Your paths.
Guide me in Your truth, and teach me; / For You are the God of my salvation; / I wait on You all the day long.
Remember Your compassions, O Jehovah, / And Your acts of kindness, for they are from of old.
The sins of my youth and my transgressions, do not remember; / According to Your lovingkindness, remember me, / For the sake of Your goodness, O Jehovah.
Jehovah is good and upright; / Therefore He instructs sinners concerning the way.
He guides the lowly in justice / And teaches the lowly His way.
All the paths of Jehovah are lovingkindness and truth / To those who observe His covenant and His testimonies.
For the sake of Your name, O Jehovah, / Pardon my iniquity, for it is great.
Who then is the man who fears Jehovah? / Him will He instruct concerning the way that he should choose.
His soul will dwell in prosperity, / And his seed will possess the land.
The intimate counsel of Jehovah is to those who fear Him, / And His covenant will He make known to them.
My eyes are continually turned to Jehovah, / For He will bring my feet out of the net.
Turn toward me, and be gracious to me, / For I am alone and afflicted.
Relieve the troubles of my heart, / And bring me out of my distresses.
Look on my affliction and my suffering, / And forgive all my sins.
Look on my enemies, for they are many; / Indeed they hate me with a violent hatred.
Keep my soul, and deliver me; / Do not let me be put to shame, / For I take refuge in You.
May integrity and uprightness preserve me, / For I wait on You.
Redeem Israel, O God, / Out of all his troubles.
