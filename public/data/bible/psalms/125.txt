Those who trust in Jehovah are like Mount Zion, / Which cannot be moved but abides forever.
Jerusalem--mountains surround her; / And Jehovah surrounds His people / From now and to eternity.
For the scepter of wickedness will not rest / Upon the allotment of the righteous, / That the righteous would not put forth / Their hands to iniquity.
Do good, O Jehovah, to the good / And to those upright in their hearts.
But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, / Jehovah will lead them off with the workers of iniquity. / Peace be upon Israel.
