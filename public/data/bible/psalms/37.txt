Do not be incensed because of evildoers; / Do not be envious of wrongdoers.
For they soon wither like grass / And fade away like green herbage.
Trust in Jehovah, and do good; / Dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness.
Delight yourself in Jehovah, / And He will give you the requests of your heart.
Commit your way to Jehovah, / And trust in Him; and He will act.
And He will cause your righteousness to go forth like light, / And your justness like noonday.
Be still before Jehovah, and wait for Him; / Do not be incensed because of him who enjoys prosperity on his way, / Because of the man who performs his evil schemes.
Cease from anger and forsake wrath; / Do not be incensed; it leads only to evil.
For the evildoers will be cut off; / But those who wait on Jehovah, / They will inherit the land.
And in a little while longer there will be no wicked man; / Indeed, you will look diligently for his place, and he will not be there.
But the lowly will inherit the land / And delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
The wicked man makes evil schemes against the righteous man / And gnashes his teeth at him.
The Lord will laugh at him, / For He sees that his day will come.
The wicked have drawn out the sword / And bent their bow, / To cast the poor and the needy down, / To slaughter those who are upright in their way.
Their sword will enter their own heart, / And their bows will be broken.
Better is the little that the righteous man has / Than the abundance of many wicked.
For the arms of the wicked will be broken, / But Jehovah upholds the righteous.
Jehovah knows the days of the perfect, / And their inheritance will be forever.
They will not be put to shame in a time of evil, / And in the days of famine they will be satisfied.
But the wicked will perish, / And the enemies of Jehovah will be like the glory of the pastures: / They are consumed; in smoke they are consumed.
The wicked one borrows but does not repay, / But the righteous one is gracious and gives.
For those blessed by Him will inherit the land, / But those cursed by Him will be cut off.
A man's steps are established by Jehovah, / And He delights in his way.
If he falls, he is not utterly cast down; / For Jehovah upholds him by the hand.
I was once a young man; now I am old. / Yet I have not seen the righteous man forsaken, / Nor his seed seeking bread.
He is always gracious and lends, / And his seed becomes a blessing.
Turn away from evil and do good, / And abide forever.
For Jehovah loves justice / And does not abandon His faithful ones; / They are kept forever; / But the seed of the wicked is cut off.
The righteous will inherit the land, / And they will abide in it forever.
The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, / And his tongue speaks justice.
The law of his God is in his heart; / His steps do not slip.
The wicked man watches for the righteous man / And seeks to slay him.
Jehovah does not leave him in his hand, / Nor let him be condemned when he is judged.
Wait for Jehovah, / And keep His way; / And He will exalt you to inherit the land; / When the wicked are cut off, you will see it.
I have seen the wicked man terrorizing, / And spreading himself like a luxuriant native tree.
Then someone passes by, and behold, he is not there; / I search for him, and he is not found.
Observe the perfect man, and watch the upright man; / For there is a future for the man of peace.
But the transgressors will be altogether destroyed; / The future of the wicked will be cut off.
And the salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah; / He is their stronghold in a time of distress.
And Jehovah helps them and rescues them; / He rescues them from the wicked, / And saves them, for they take refuge in Him.
