Jehovah reigns; He is clothed with majesty. / Jehovah is clothed, He has girded Himself, with strength. / Indeed the world has been established; it will not be moved.
Your throne is established from of old; / You are from eternity.
The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah; / The floods have lifted up their voice; / The floods lift up their roaring.
More than the voices of many waters, / Than the mighty breakers of the sea, / Jehovah on high is mighty!
Your testimonies are very sure; / Holiness befits Your house, / O Jehovah, forevermore.
