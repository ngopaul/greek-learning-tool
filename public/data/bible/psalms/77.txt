My voice calls out to God, and I will cry out; / My voice calls out to God, and He will give ear to me.
In the day of my distress I sought the Lord; / My hand was stretched out in the night, and it did not drop. / My soul refused to be comforted.
I remember God, and I moan; / I complain, and my spirit faints. Selah
You hold open my eyelids; / I am disturbed and cannot speak.
I consider the days of old, / The years of ancient times;
I remember my song in the night; / I muse with my own heart, and my spirit carefully searches.
Will the Lord cast us off forever, / And will He never be favorable to us again?
Has His lovingkindness ceased forever? / Has the promise come to an end for all generations?
Has God forgotten to be gracious? / Or has He in anger shut up His compassions? Selah
Then I said, This is my infirmity; / But I recall the years of the right hand of the Most High.
I will bring to remembrance the deeds of Jehovah, / For I will remember Your wonders from of old.
And I will meditate on all that You have done / And muse on Your doings.
O God, Your way is in the sanctuary; / Who is so great a god as God?
You are the God who does wonders; / You have made known Your strength among the peoples.
You redeemed Your people with Your arm, / The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
The waters saw You, O God; / The waters saw You; they were afraid; / Indeed the depths trembled.
The clouds poured forth water; / The skies sent forth a sound; / Indeed Your arrows went here and there.
The sound of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; / Lightning illuminated the world; / The earth trembled and quaked.
Your way was in the sea, / And Your paths in the great waters; / And Your footsteps were not known.
You led Your people like a flock / By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
