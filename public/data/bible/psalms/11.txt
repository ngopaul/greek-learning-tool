In Jehovah have I taken refuge. How can you say to my soul, / Flee to the mountains like a bird?
For behold, the wicked bend the bow; / They ready their arrow on the string / To shoot in the dark at the upright in heart.
When the foundations are destroyed, / What will the righteous man do?
Jehovah is in His holy temple; / Jehovah--His throne is in heaven. / His eyes behold; / His eyelids try the sons of men.
Jehovah tries the righteous man; / But the wicked man and him who loves violence, His soul hates.
He will rain down snares upon the wicked; / Fire and brimstone and a scorching wind will be the portion of their cup.
For Jehovah is righteous; He loves righteous deeds. / The upright man will behold His face.
