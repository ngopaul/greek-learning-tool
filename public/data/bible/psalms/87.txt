His foundation is in the holy mountains.
Jehovah loves the gates of Zion / More than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of you, / O city of God. Selah
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as those who know Me; / Behold, Philistia and Tyre along with Cush: / This one was born there, they say.
But of Zion it will be said, / This one and that one were born in her, / And the Most High Himself will establish her.
Jehovah will count / When He records the peoples: / This One was born there. Selah
Then singing as well as dancing, they will say, / All my springs are in you.
