God be gracious to us and bless us; / May He make His face shine upon us; Selah
That Your way may be known on earth, / And Your salvation among all the nations.
Let the peoples praise You, O God; / Let the peoples praise You, all of them.
Let the nations rejoice and shout for joy, / For You will judge the peoples equitably / And will guide the nations on the earth. Selah
Let the peoples praise You, O God; / Let the peoples praise You, all of them.
The earth has yielded its increase; / God, our God, blesses us.
God blesses us; / And all the ends of the earth will fear Him.
