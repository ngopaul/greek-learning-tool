To my words give ear, O Jehovah; / Consider my moaning.
Give heed to the sound of my cry, / My King and my God; / For to You do I pray.
O Jehovah, in the morning / You will hear my voice; / In the morning I will set forth my words in order to You, / And I will watch.
For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; / Evil will not sojourn with You.
Those who boast will not stand / Before Your eyes; / You hate all workers of iniquity.
You will destroy those who speak lies. / Jehovah abhors a man of bloodshed and deceit.
But as for me, in the abundance of Your lovingkindness / I will come into Your house; / I will bow down toward Your holy temple / In fear of You.
O Jehovah, lead me in Your righteousness / On account of those who lie in wait for me; / Make Your way straight before me.
For there is no truth in their mouth; / Their inward part is corruption itself; / Their throat is an open grave; / They flatter with their tongue.
Hold them guilty, O God; / Let them fall by their own counsels; / Because of the multitude of their transgressions thrust them out, / For they have rebelled against You.
But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; / Let them shout for joy forever; / And may You spread a cover over them; / And those who love Your name / Will exult in You.
For You will bless the righteous man, O Jehovah; / You will surround him with favor as with a shield.
