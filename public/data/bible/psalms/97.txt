Jehovah reigns! Let the earth be glad; / Let the many islands rejoice.
Clouds and deep darkness surround Him; / Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.
A fire goes before Him / And burns up His adversaries all around.
His lightning illumines the world; / The earth sees and trembles.
The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Jehovah, / At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
The heavens declare His righteousness, / And all the peoples see His glory.
Let all who serve a graven image be ashamed, / Who make their boast in idols; / Worship Him, all you gods.
Zion hears and rejoices, / And the daughters of Judah are glad, / Because of Your judgments, O Jehovah.
For You, O Jehovah, are most high over all the earth; / You are exalted far above all gods.
O you who love Jehovah, hate evil! / He preserves the souls of His faithful ones; / He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous man, / And rejoicing for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in Jehovah, O righteous ones; / And praise His holy memorial.
