O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, / I have cried out by day and in the night before You.
May my prayer come before You; / Incline Your ear to my cry.
For my soul is full of troubles, / And my life draws near to Sheol.
I am accounted among those who go down into the pit; / I am like a man without any help,
Abandoned among the dead, / Like the slain that lie in the grave, / Whom You remember no more, / And they are cut off from Your hand.
You have put me in the lowest pit, / In the dark places, in the depths.
Your wrath lies heavily upon me, / And You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah
You have put my acquaintances far from me; / You have made me an abomination to them. / I am shut in and cannot go out.
My eye wastes away at the affliction; / I have called out to You, O Jehovah, every day; / I have spread out my hands to You.
Will You perform wonders for the dead? / Will the deceased rise up and praise You? Selah
Will Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave, / Or Your faithfulness in Abaddon?
Will Your wonders be made known in the darkness, / Or Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
But I, O Jehovah, have cried out to You; / And in the morning my prayer comes before You.
Why, O Jehovah, have You rejected my soul? / Why do You hide Your face from me?
I have been afflicted and about to die since my youth; / I bear Your terrors; I am overwhelmed.
Your fierce wrath has gone over me; / Your terrors have cut me off.
They surrounded me like water all day long; / They altogether encompassed me.
You have put far from me / Lover and friend; / My acquaintances are in darkness.
