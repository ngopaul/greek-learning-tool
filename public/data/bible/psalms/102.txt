O Jehovah, hear my prayer; / And let my cry come unto You.
Do not hide Your face from me / On the day of my distress; / Incline Your ear to me; / On the day when I call out, answer me quickly.
For my days are consumed in smoke, / And my bones burn like a hearth.
My heart is stricken like grass and dried up; / Indeed I have even forgotten to eat my bread.
Because of the voice of my groaning / My bones cling to my flesh.
I am like a pelican of the wilderness; / I have become like an owl of the desolate places.
I watch, and I am like / A lone sparrow on a housetop.
All day long my enemies reproach me; / Those who deride me use me as a curse.
For I have eaten ashes like bread, / And have mixed my drink with weeping,
Because of Your indignation and Your wrath; / For You have taken me up and cast me away.
My days are like a shadow that declines, / And I am dried up like grass.
But You, O Jehovah, abide forever; / And Your memorial is from generation to generation.
You will arise and have compassion on Zion, / For it is time to be gracious to her; the appointed time has come.
For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, / And show favor to her dust.
And the nations will fear the name of Jehovah, / And all the kings of the earth, Your glory;
For Jehovah has built up Zion; / He has appeared in His glory.
He has regarded the prayer of the destitute, / And has not despised their prayer.
This will be written for a generation to come, / And a people to be created will praise Jehovah.
For He has looked down from the height of His sanctuary; / From heaven Jehovah beheld the earth,
To hear the groaning of the prisoner, / To release those appointed to die;
That the name of Jehovah may be declared in Zion, / And His praise, in Jerusalem,
When the peoples are gathered together, / And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.
He has weakened my strength in the way; / He has shortened my days.
I said, My God, / Do not take me away in the middle of my days; / Your years are throughout all generations.
Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, / And the heavens are the work of Your hands.
They will perish, but You endure; / Indeed all of them will wear out like a garment; / Like clothing You will change them, / And they will be changed.
But You are the same, / And Your years are without end.
The children of Your servants will continue, / And their seed will be established before You.
