Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; / Set me on high, secure from those who rise up against me.
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, / And save me from men of bloodshed.
For behold, they lie in wait for my soul; / The strong gather themselves against me. / Not because of any transgression of mine nor because of any sin of mine, O Jehovah,
Not for any fault of mine, they run and ready themselves; / Awake to meet me, and see.
Indeed You, O Jehovah, God of hosts, God of Israel, / Arise to punish all the nations; / Have no mercy upon any who treacherously commit iniquity. Selah
They return in the evening; / They growl like a dog / And go around the city.
Behold, they belch forth with their mouth; / Swords are in their lips; / For, Who, they say, hears?
But You, O Jehovah, laugh at them; / You have all the nations in derision.
O my strength, I will watch for You; / For God is my high retreat.
My God in His lovingkindness will meet me; / God will let me look triumphantly upon those who lie in wait for me.
Do not slay them, lest my people forget; / Scatter them by Your power, and bring them down, / O Lord our shield.
For the sin of their mouth, / For the word of their lips, / Let them even be taken in their arrogance, / And because of the cursing and the lying that they speak.
Consume them in wrath; consume them so that they are no more; / And men will know that God rules in Jacob / Unto the ends of the earth. Selah
They return in the evening; / They growl like a dog / And go around the city.
They wander about for food; / And if they are not filled, they linger.
But I will sing of Your strength; / And I will joyfully sing of Your lovingkindness in the morning. / For You have been my high retreat / And a refuge in the day of my distress.
O my strength, unto You I will sing psalms, / For God is my high retreat, / My God of lovingkindness.
