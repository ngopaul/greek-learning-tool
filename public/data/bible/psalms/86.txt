Incline Your ear, O Jehovah; answer me; / For I am poor and needy.
Keep my soul; for I am faithful; / Save Your servant who trusts in You, O You who are my God.
Be gracious to me, O Lord; / For to You do I call out all day long.
Cause the soul of Your servant to rejoice, / For unto You, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For You, O Lord, are good and ready to forgive / And abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon You.
Give ear, O Jehovah, to my prayer, / And give heed to the voice of my supplications.
In the day of my distress I call upon You, / For You answer me.
There is none like You among the gods, O Lord; / Nor are there any works like Yours.
All the nations which You have made will come / And worship before You, O Lord; / And they will glorify Your name.
For You are great, and You do wondrous deeds; / You alone are God.
Teach me, O Jehovah, Your way; / I will walk in Your truth. / Make my heart single in fearing Your name.
I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart; / And I will glorify Your name forever.
For Your lovingkindness is great toward me, / And You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
O God, the proud have risen up against me, / And a company of violent men seek my life; / And they do not set You before them.
But You, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, / Long-suffering and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.
Turn to me and be gracious to me; / Give Your strength to Your servant, / And save the son of Your female servant.
Show me a token of goodness, / That those who hate me may see it and be ashamed; / For You, O Jehovah, have helped me and comforted me.
