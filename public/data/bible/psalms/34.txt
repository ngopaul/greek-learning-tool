I will bless Jehovah at all times; / His praise will continually be in my mouth.
My soul makes its boast in Jehovah; / The lowly hear and they rejoice.
Magnify Jehovah with me, / And let us exalt His name together.
I sought Jehovah, and He answered me; / And He delivered me from all that terrified me.
They looked to Him and were radiant; / And their faces will never be abashed.
This poor man called out, and Jehovah heard; / And He saved him out of all his troubles.
The angel of Jehovah encamps / Around those who fear Him, and He delivers them.
Taste and see that Jehovah is good; / Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him.
Fear Jehovah, you who are His saints; / For there is no lack with those who fear Him.
The young lions hunger and starve, / But those who seek Jehovah will not lack any good thing.
Come, children; hear me. / I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.
Who is the man who desires life, / Who loves having days in order to see good?
Guard your tongue from evil, / And your lips from speaking deceit.
Turn away from evil and do good; / Seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of Jehovah are set toward the righteous, / And His ears, toward their cry.
The face of Jehovah is against those who do evil, / To cut off the memory of them from the earth.
The righteous cry out, and Jehovah hears; / And He saves them out of all their troubles.
Jehovah is near to those who are broken in heart, / And He saves those who are contrite in spirit.
Many are the troubles of the righteous man, / But Jehovah delivers him from all of them.
He keeps all his bones; / Not one of them is broken.
Evil will slay the wicked, / And those who hate the righteous man will be condemned.
Jehovah redeems the soul of His servants, / And none who take refuge in Him will be condemned.
