Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; / Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable; / I will utter riddles from of old,
Which we have heard and known, / And our fathers have related to us.
We will not hide them from their children, / But will relate to the generation to come / The praises of Jehovah and His strength / And His wondrous deeds that He has done.
Indeed He has established a testimony in Jacob / And appointed a law in Israel, / Which He commanded our fathers / That they should make them known to their children;
That the generation to come, / The children to be born, may know them, / Who should arise and relate them to their children;
That they might set their hope in God, / And not forget the deeds of God, / But observe His commandments;
That they might not be like their fathers, / A stubborn and rebellious generation, / A generation that did not set their heart right, / And whose spirit was not faithful to God.
The children of Ephraim, armed archers with bows, / Turned back in the day of battle.
They did not keep the covenant of God, / And they refused to walk in His law.
And they forgot His doings / And His wondrous deeds that He had shown them.
He did something wonderful in the sight of their fathers / In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, / And He made the water stand as a heap.
And He led them with the cloud by day / And all the night with a light of fire.
He split rocks in the wilderness / And gave them abundant drink, as from the depths.
He also brought forth streams from the rock / And made water run down like rivers.
Yet they still continued to sin against Him, / To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
And they put God to the test in their heart, / By asking for food according to their desire.
They also spoke against God; / They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
Behold, He struck the rock, / And water gushed out, / And streams overflowed; / Can He also give us bread, / Or provide meat for His people?
Therefore Jehovah heard and was angry. / And a fire was kindled against Jacob, / And also anger went up against Israel;
Because they did not believe in God, / And they did not trust in His salvation.
Yet He commanded the skies above / And opened the doors of heaven;
And He rained down upon them manna to eat / And gave them the food of heaven.
Man ate the bread of the mighty; / He sent them full provision.
He made the east wind blow in the heavens / And guided the south wind by His strength.
And He rained upon them meat like dust, / And winged birds like the sand of the seas.
And He made it fall in the midst of their camp, / Around their habitations.
So they ate and were well filled; / Indeed what they desired He brought to them.
They were not estranged from what they desired; / Their food was still in their mouths
When the anger of God went up against them / And slew some of their fattest ones / And struck down the choice men of Israel.
In spite of all this they still sinned / And did not believe in His wondrous deeds.
Therefore He consumed their days with vanity, / And their years with terror.
When He slew them, they inquired after Him, / And they returned and diligently sought God.
And they remembered that God was their rock, / And the Most High God, their Redeemer.
But they flattered Him with their mouth / And lied to Him with their tongue.
For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, / Nor were they faithful to His covenant.
But He, being merciful, forgave their iniquity / And did not destroy them; / Indeed He turned back His anger many times / And did not stir up all His wrath.
And He remembered that they were flesh, / A wind that goes away and does not return.
How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness / And grieved Him in the desert!
And they repeatedly put God to the test / And provoked the Holy One of Israel.
They did not remember His hand, / The day when He ransomed them from the adversary;
When He set His signs in Egypt / And His wonders in the field of Zoan;
And He turned their rivers into blood, / As well as their streams, so that they could not drink.
He sent among them a swarm of flies, which devoured them; / And frogs, which destroyed them.
And He gave their increase to the consuming locust, / And their labor to the swarming locust.
He killed their vines with hail, / And their sycamores with ice stones.
He gave over their cattle also to the hail / And their herds to the lightning bolts.
He sent among them the burning fierceness of His anger, / Overflowing wrath and indignation and trouble, / A mission of angels of evils.
He leveled a path for His anger; / He did not spare their soul from death, / But gave their life over to the pestilence.
And He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, / The firstfruits of their vigor in the tents of Ham.
But He set forth His people like sheep / And led them like a flock in the wilderness.
And He led them to safety, so that they did not fear; / But the sea covered their enemies.
And He brought them forth to His holy border, / The mountain, which His right hand had acquired.
And He drove out the nations before them / And allotted them as an inheritance by line, / And He made the tribes of Israel dwell there in their tents.
Yet they put Him to the test and rebelled against God the Most High, / And did not keep His testimonies.
And they turned back and dealt treacherously, as their fathers had done; / They turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Indeed they provoked Him to anger with their high places / And made Him jealous with their graven images.
God heard, and He was angered; / And He greatly abhorred Israel.
Thus He forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, / The tent in which He dwelt among men;
And He gave over His Ark into captivity, / And His glory into the hand of the adversary.
He also delivered His people to the sword / And was angry with His inheritance.
Fire devoured their young men, / And their virgins had no marriage song.
Their priests fell by the sword, / And their widows did not lament.
Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, / Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.
And He struck His adversaries and sent them back; / He put an everlasting reproach upon them.
And He rejected the tent of Joseph, / And the tribe of Ephraim He did not choose.
Rather He chose the tribe of Judah, / Mount Zion, which He loved.
And He built His sanctuary like the heights, / Like the earth that He has founded forever.
Moreover He chose David His servant / And took him from the sheepfolds;
From following after the ewes He brought him / To shepherd Jacob His people / And Israel His inheritance.
And he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, / And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
