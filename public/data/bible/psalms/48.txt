Great is Jehovah, / And much to be praised / In the city of our God, / In His holy mountain.
Beautiful in elevation, / The joy of the whole earth, / Is Mount Zion, the sides of the north, / The city of the great King.
God has made Himself known / In her palaces as a high retreat.
For, behold, the kings have assembled themselves; / They passed by together.
They saw; therefore they were astounded. / They were dismayed; they hurried off in alarm.
Trembling seized them there; / Writhing, like that of a woman in labor;
With an east wind You shattered / The ships of Tarshish.
As we have heard, / So we have seen / In the city of Jehovah of hosts, / In the city of our God. / God will establish her forever. Selah
We consider, O God, Your lovingkindness / In the midst of Your temple.
As Your name is, O God, / So is Your praise / Unto the ends of the earth; / Your right hand is full of righteousness.
Let Mount Zion rejoice; / Let the daughters of Judah exult / Because of Your judgments.
Walk about Zion, and go around her; / Count her towers.
Consider carefully her bulwarks; / Pass between her palaces; / That you may recount it to the generation following.
For this God is our God forever and ever. / He will guide us even unto death.
