Jehovah reigns; let the peoples tremble. / He is enthroned between the cherubim; let the earth shake.
Jehovah is great in Zion, / And He is exalted over all the peoples.
Let them praise Your great and awesome name--/ It is holy--
And the strength of the King, who loves justice. / You have established equity; / You have executed / Justice and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt Jehovah our God, / And worship at His footstool; / Holy is He.
Moses and Aaron among His priests, / And Samuel among those who called on His name--/ They called out to Jehovah, / And He answered them.
In the pillar of cloud He spoke to them; / They kept His testimonies and the statute that He gave them.
O Jehovah our God, You answered them; / You were a forgiving God to them, / Yet One avenging their deeds.
Exalt Jehovah our God, / And worship on His holy mountain; / For holy is Jehovah our God.
