O Jehovah our Lord, / How excellent is Your name / In all the earth, / You who have set Your glory over the heavens!
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings / You have established strength / Because of Your adversaries, / To stop the enemy and the avenger.
When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers, / The moon and the stars, which You have ordained,
What is mortal man, that You remember him, / And the son of man, that You visit him?
You have made Him a little lower than angels / And have crowned Him with glory and honor.
For You have caused Him to rule over the works of Your hands; / You have put all things under His feet:
All sheep and oxen, / As well as the beasts of the field,
The birds of heaven and the fish of the sea, / Whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
O Jehovah our Lord, / How excellent is Your name / In all the earth!
