God stands in the congregation of God; / He judges in the midst of the gods.
How long will you judge unjustly / And respect the persons of the wicked? Selah
Judge the poor and the orphan; / Execute justice for the afflicted and the destitute;
Rescue the poor and the needy; / Deliver them from the hand of the wicked.
You do not know, nor do you understand; / You go about in darkness; / All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I said, You are gods, / And all of you are sons of the Most High.
Nevertheless you will die like men / And fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God; judge the earth; / For You will inherit all the nations.
