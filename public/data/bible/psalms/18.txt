I love You, O Jehovah, my strength.
Jehovah is my crag and my fortress and my Deliverer; / My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; / My shield and the horn of my salvation, my high retreat.
I called upon Jehovah, who is worthy of praise, / And from my enemies I was saved.
The cords of death encompassed me; / And the torrents of destruction assailed me.
The cords of Sheol surrounded me; / The snares of death confronted me.
In my distress I called upon Jehovah / And cried out to my God. / He heard my voice from His temple, / And my cry before Him came to His ears.
Then the earth shook and quaked, / And the foundations of the mountains trembled and shook about, / For He was furious.
Smoke went up from His nostrils, / And fire from His mouth devoured; / Coals blazed forth from Him.
He bowed the heavens down and descended, / And deep darkness was under His feet.
He rode upon a cherub and did fly; / He darted upon the wings of the wind.
He made darkness His hiding place, His pavilion around Him: / Dark waterclouds, thick clouds of the skies.
Out of the brightness before Him there broke through His clouds / Hail and fiery coals.
Then Jehovah thundered in heaven, / And the Most High uttered His voice.
And He sent forth His arrows and scattered my enemies; / And He shot forth lightning bolts and discomfited them.
The channels of the sea were seen, / And the foundations of the habitable land were laid bare / At Your rebuke, O Jehovah, / At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
He reached forth from on high; He took me; / He drew me out of great waters.
He delivered me from my strong enemy / And from those who hate me, for they were too mighty for me.
They confronted me in the day of my calamity, / But Jehovah became my support.
He brought me forth to a place broad and free; / He rescued me, for He took delight in me.
Jehovah has recompensed me according to my righteousness; / According to the cleanness of my hands He has repaid me.
For I have kept the ways of Jehovah / And have not acted wickedly by turning away from my God.
For all His judgments were before me, / And I did not turn His statutes away from me.
I was perfect toward Him, / And I kept myself from my iniquity.
Therefore Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, / According to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.
With the faithful You show Yourself faithful, / With a perfect man You show Yourself perfect,
With the pure You show Yourself pure, / And with the perverse You show Yourself contrary.
For it is You who save the afflicted people, / But the haughty eyes You bring down;
For it is You who light my lamp; / Jehovah my God lights up my darkness;
For by You I can run up against a troop; / Indeed by my God I can leap over a wall.
As for God, His way is perfect; / The word of Jehovah is tried. / He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
For who is God other than Jehovah, / And who is a rock but our God?
The God who girds me with strength / And makes my way perfect,
Who makes my feet like hinds' feet / And sets me on my high places,
Who teaches my hands to wage war / So that my arms may bend a bronze bow.
And You have given me the shield of Your salvation, / And Your right hand supports me; / And Your condescending gentleness has made me great.
You have broadened the places of my steps under me, / And my feet have not slipped.
I pursued my enemies and overtook them, / And I did not turn back until they were consumed.
I shattered them, so that they were not able to rise up; / They fell under my feet.
And You girded me with strength for war; / You brought down under me those who rose up against me.
You also made my enemies turn their back to me, / And I annihilated those who hated me.
They cried out, but there was no one to save them; / They cried out to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.
Then I beat them like dust before the wind; / Like the mud of the streets I pounded them.
You rescued me from the strivings of the people; / You have made me the head of the nations; / A people whom I had not known serves me.
At the mere hearing of a report, they obey me; / Foreigners come cringing to me;
Foreigners are discouraged / And come quaking out of their fortresses.
Jehovah lives; and blessed be my rock, / And exalted be the God of my salvation,
The God who executes vengeance for me / And subdues peoples under me,
Who rescues me from my enemies. / Indeed You exalted me above those who rise up against me; / From the violent man You delivered me.
Therefore I give thanks to You among the nations, O Jehovah; / And I will sing psalms to Your name.
It is He who magnifies salvation to His king / And executes lovingkindness to His anointed, / To David and to his seed forever.
