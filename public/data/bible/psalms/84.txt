How lovely are Your tabernacles, / O Jehovah of hosts!
My soul longs, indeed even faints, / For the courts of Jehovah; / My heart and my flesh cry out / To the living God.
At Your two altars even the sparrow has found a home; / And the swallow, a nest for herself, / Where she may lay her young, / O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; / They will yet be praising You. Selah
Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, / In whose heart are the highways to Zion.
Passing through the valley of Baca, / They make it a spring; / Indeed the early rain covers it with blessings.
They go from strength to strength; / Each appears before God in Zion.
O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer; / Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah
Behold our shield, O God; / And look upon the face of Your anointed.
For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand; / I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God / Than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield; / Jehovah gives grace and glory; / He does not withhold anything good / From those who walk uprightly.
O Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man / Who trusts in You.
