Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven; / Whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man to whom / Jehovah does not impute iniquity / And in whose spirit there is no deceit.
When I kept silent, my bones wasted away / Through my groaning all day long.
For day and night Your hand / Was heavy upon me; / My life sap was dried up / As in the drought of summer. Selah
I acknowledged my sin to You, / And I did not cover my iniquity. / I said, I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah. / Then You forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah
Because of this let everyone who is faithful / Pray to You at a time when You may be found; / Surely when great waters overflow, / They will not reach him.
You are my hiding place; / You preserve me from trouble; / You surround me with the ringing shouts of deliverance. Selah
I will instruct you and teach you concerning the way you should go; / I will counsel you; My eye is upon you.
Do not be like a horse or like a mule, without understanding; / Whose trappings consist of bit and bridle to restrain them, / Else they do not come near you.
Many are the sorrows that the wicked have; / But he who trusts in Jehovah is encompassed by lovingkindness.
Rejoice in Jehovah and exult, O righteous ones; / And give a ringing shout, all you who are upright in heart.
