Hear this, all you peoples; / Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world,
Both low and high, / Rich and poor together;
My mouth will speak wisdom, / And the meditation of my heart will be that of understanding.
I will incline my ear to a parable; / I will disclose my riddle upon the harp.
Why should I fear in the days of evil, / When the iniquity of those who supplant me surrounds me,
Those who trust in their wealth / And boast in the multitude of their riches?
None can by any means redeem his brother / Or give to God a ransom for him
(For the redemption of their soul is costly / And must be given up forever),
That he would yet live always / And not see corruption.
For he will see that wise men die; / The foolish one and the senseless one perish alike / And leave their wealth to others.
Their inward thought is that their houses will remain forever, / That their habitations will remain from generation to generation; / They call lands after their own names.
But man in honor does not remain; / He is like the beasts that perish.
Such is the way of those who are self-confident, / And of those after them who approve of their sayings. Selah
Like a flock, they are appointed for Sheol; / Death will shepherd them. / And straight to the grave they will descend, / And their form will be for Sheol to consume / That there be no abode for them.
But God will redeem my soul / From the power of Sheol, / For He will receive me. Selah
Do not fear when a man becomes rich, / When the glory of his house increases.
For when he dies, he will take nothing; / His glory will not descend after him.
Though he blessed his soul while he lived--/ And men praise you when you do good for yourself--
It will go to the generation of his fathers; / They will never see light.
A man in honor but without understanding / Is like the beasts that perish.
