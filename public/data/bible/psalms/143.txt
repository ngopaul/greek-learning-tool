O Jehovah, hear my prayer; / Give ear to my supplications; / Answer me in Your faithfulness and in Your righteousness;
And do not enter into judgment with Your servant, / For no one alive is righteous in Your sight.
For the enemy has persecuted my soul; / He has crushed my life down to the ground; / He has caused me to dwell in dark places, like those who have been long dead.
Therefore my spirit faints within me; / My heart is appalled in the midst of me.
I remember the days of old; / I meditate upon all that You have done; / I muse upon the work of Your hands.
I spread out my hands to You; / My soul thirsts for You like a parched land. Selah
Hurry and answer me, O Jehovah; / My spirit fails. / Do not hide Your face from me, / Lest I become like those who go down into the pit.
Cause me to hear Your lovingkindness in the morning, / For in You I trust. / Make known to me the way on which I should walk, / For to You I lift up my soul.
Deliver me from my enemies, O Jehovah; / I have fled to You for a refuge.
Teach me to do Your will, / For You are my God; / Let Your good Spirit lead me / In a plain country.
For Your name's sake, O Jehovah, preserve me alive; / In Your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
And in Your lovingkindness cut off my enemies / And destroy all those who oppress my soul, / For I am Your servant.
