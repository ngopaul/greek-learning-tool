May Jehovah answer you in the day of trouble; / May the name of the God of Jacob set you on high.
May He send you help from the sanctuary / And support you from Zion.
May He remember all your meal offerings / And accept your burnt offering. Selah
May He give you according to your heart's desire / And fulfill all your intention.
May we shout victoriously in Your salvation / And raise the banner in the name of our God. / May Jehovah fulfill all your petitions.
Now I know / That Jehovah saves His anointed; / He will answer him from His holy heaven / With mighty acts of salvation from His right hand.
Some boast in chariots, and some in horses; / But we boast in the name of Jehovah our God.
They are humbled and fallen, / But we have risen and stand upright.
Save, O Jehovah! / May the king answer us when we call.
