And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, all who had knowledge and who had understanding,
Join with their brothers, their nobles, and enter into a curse and an oath, to walk in the law of God, which was given through Moses the servant of God, and to keep and do all the commandments of Jehovah our Lord, as well as His ordinances and His statutes;
And swear that we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land nor take their daughters for our sons;
And if the peoples of the land bring in wares or any grain on the Sabbath day to sell, we will not buy it from them on the Sabbath or on any holy day; and we will forego the crops of the seventh year and the exaction of every debt.
We also lay upon ourselves obligations to charge ourselves one-third shekel yearly for the service of the house of our God,
For the rows of bread, and for the continual meal offering, and for the continual burnt offering, for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, for the appointed feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings, to make expiation for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.
And we the priests, the Levites, and the people have cast lots for the wood offering, in order to bring it to the house of our God, according to our fathers' houses, at appointed times year by year, to burn on the altar of Jehovah our God as it is written in the law;
And in order to bring the firstfruits of our land and the firstfruits of all the fruit of every tree year by year to the house of Jehovah,
As well as the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, as it is written in the law; and in order to bring the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God.
We will also bring the first of our dough and our heave offerings and of the fruit of every tree and the new wine and the fresh oil to the priests at the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our land to the Levites; for they, the Levites, are those who receive the tithes in all our rural towns.
And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive the tithes; and the Levites shall bring the tithe of the tithes up to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse.
For the children of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the heave offering of the grain, of the new wine, and of the fresh oil to the chambers, where the vessels of the sanctuary, the priests who minister, and the gatekeepers and the singers are; and we will not forsake the house of our God.
