These are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each man to his city;

The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty-two.
And of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife from among the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called after their name.
These sought their registry among those who were enrolled by genealogy, but it was not found; therefore they were considered defiled and were excluded from the priesthood.
And the governor told them that they should not eat of the most holy things until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.
The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,
Besides their male servants and their female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven; and they had two hundred forty-five male singers and female singers.

And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand minas of silver and sixty-seven priests' garments.
So the priests and the Levites and the gatekeepers and the singers and some of the people and the temple servants and all Israel dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.
