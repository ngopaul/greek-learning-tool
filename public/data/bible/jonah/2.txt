Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from the stomach of the fish,
And he said, I called out because of my distress / To Jehovah, and He answered me; / From the belly of Sheol I cried out for help; / You heard my voice.
You flung me into the depths, into the heart of the sea, / And the flood surrounded me; / All Your breakers and Your billows / Passed over me.
Therefore I said, I have been driven out / From before Your eyes; / Yet I will look again / Toward Your holy temple.
Water encompassed me, even to my soul; / The deep surrounded me; / Seaweed was wrapped about my head.
To the bottom of the sea mountains I went down; / The earth with its bars was around me forever. / Then You have brought up my life from the pit, / O Jehovah my God.
When my soul fainted within me, / I remembered Jehovah, / And my prayer came to You / In Your holy temple.
Those who regard empty vanities / Forsake the lovingkindness to them;
But I will sacrifice to You / With the voice of thanksgiving; / That which I have vowed I will fully pay. / Salvation is of Jehovah.
And Jehovah spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out onto the dry land.
