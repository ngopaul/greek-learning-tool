Then the word of Jehovah came to Jonah a second time, saying,
Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city; and proclaim to it the proclamation that I will speak to you.
So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three days' journey in size.
And Jonah began to go through the city a day's journey and cried out and said, Yet forty days and Nineveh will be overturned!
And the men of Nineveh believed God, and they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
And the word reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne and put away his majestic clothes from him and covered himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes.
And he issued a proclamation and declared in Nineveh by the decree of the king and his great men, saying, Let neither man nor beast nor herd nor flock taste anything; let them not feed, nor let them drink water.
And let man and beast be covered in sackcloth, and let them call to God strongly. And let each turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands.
Who knows whether God will turn and repent, and will turn from His burning anger so that we do not perish?
And God saw their deeds, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented for the evil that He said He would do to them; and He did not do it.
