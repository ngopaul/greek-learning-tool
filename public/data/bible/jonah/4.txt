But it displeased Jonah greatly, and he was angry.
And he prayed to Jehovah and said, Ah, Jehovah, was this not what I said when I was still in my land? Therefore I anticipated it by fleeing to Tarshish, for I know that You are a gracious and compassionate God, long-suffering and abundant in lovingkindness and repentant of evil.
And now, Jehovah, take my life, I pray, from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.
And Jehovah said, Do you do well to be angry?
Then Jonah went out from the city and sat to the east of the city. And he made a booth for himself there and sat underneath it in the shade until he could see what would happen to the city.
And Jehovah God prepared a castor-oil tree; and it came up over Jonah to be a shade over his head, that it might deliver him from his misfortune. And Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the tree.
But God prepared a worm when the dawn came up the next day, and it struck the tree, and the tree withered.
And when the sun rose, God prepared a sultry east wind. And the sun beat down on Jonah's head, and he fainted. And he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
And God said to Jonah, Do you do well to be angry about the tree? And he said, I do well to be angry unto death.
And Jehovah said, You had pity on the tree that you did not labor for nor cause to grow, which came into being overnight and perished overnight;
And I, should I not have pity on Nineveh, the great city, in which are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot discern between their right hand and their left, and many cattle?
