I will stand at my watch / And station myself on the fortress, / And I will watch to see what He will speak to me / And what I will reply concerning my complaint.
Then Jehovah answered me and said, Write the vision, and render it plainly upon tablets, / That even he who runs by may read it.
For the vision is yet for the appointed time, / And it hastens toward the end and will not lie. / Though it tarries, wait for it; / For it will surely come; it will not delay.
See, he who is puffed up, his soul is not upright within him, / But the righteous one will live by his faith.
Furthermore his wine is treacherous: / A boasting man, he does not abide at home, / He who enlarges his appetite like Sheol, / And is like death and cannot be satisfied, / But gathers to himself all the nations / And collects for himself all the peoples.
Will not all of these take up a parable against him, / Indeed a mocking song and a riddle against him, and say, / Woe to him who increases what is not his (For how long?) / And who loads himself with the burden of pledges?
Will not those who bite you rise up suddenly, / And those who shake you awake, / And you will become booty to them?
Because you have plundered many nations; / All the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, / Because of the bloodshed of men and the violence done to the land, / To the city, and to all the inhabitants in it.
Woe to him who by violence takes evil gain for his house, / So as to place his nest on high / That he may be delivered from the hand of evil!
You have devised shame against your own house / By cutting off many peoples, / And have sinned against your own soul.
For the stone will cry out from the wall, / And the rafter will answer it from the timber.
Woe to him who builds a city by bloodshed / And establishes a town by iniquity!
Indeed is it not of Jehovah of hosts / That the peoples toil for the fire / And the nations weary themselves for vanity?
For the earth will be filled / With the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah / As water covers the sea.
Woe to him who makes his neighbor drink, / Adding in his poison, / And also making him drunk / In order to look at their nakedness!
You are sated with shame, not glory. / You also, drink and be shown to be uncircumcised! / The cup of Jehovah's right hand will come around to you, / And disgrace will be upon your glory.
For the violence done to Lebanon will cover you, / As well as the destruction of the beasts which frightened them, / Because of the bloodshed of men and the violence done to the land, / To the city, and to all the inhabitants in it.
What profit is the graven idol that its maker should engrave it, / Or the molten idol, even the teacher of lies, / That he who forms its form depends on it / To make dumb idols?
Woe to him who says to wood, Awake! / And, Arise! to silent stone. / Will it teach him? / Behold, it is set in gold and silver, / And there is no breath at all within it.
But Jehovah is in His holy temple: / Be silent before Him, all the earth!
