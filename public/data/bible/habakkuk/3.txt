A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet in shigionoth.
O Jehovah, I have heard the report concerning You and am afraid. / O Jehovah, revive Your work / In the midst of the years; / In the midst of the years make it known; / In wrath remember compassion.
God comes from Teman, / Even the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah / His splendor covers the heavens, / And the earth is filled with His praise.
And His brightness is like the light: / Rays come forth from His hand, / And the hiding of His power is there.
Before Him goes pestilence, / And the fire bolt comes forth at His feet.
He stands and measures the earth; / He looks and startles the nations; / And the ancient mountains are shattered into dust, / And the everlasting hills sink down; / His goings are eternal.
I see the tents of Cushan / Under affliction; / The tent curtains of the land of Midian tremble.
Is it against the rivers, O Jehovah, / Against the rivers that Your anger is kindled? / Is Your overflowing wrath against the sea / That You ride upon Your horses, / Upon Your chariots of salvation?
Your bow is bared utterly; / The rods of discipline are sworn according to Your word. Selah / You cleave the earth with rivers.
The mountains see You; they writhe; / The tempest of water passes by; / The deep utters its voice, / It lifts its hands high.
The sun and the moon stand still in their high abode / At the light of Your arrows going forth, / At the brightness of Your glittering spear.
In wrath You march through the earth, / In anger You thresh the nations.
You go forth for the salvation of Your people, / For the salvation of Your anointed one; / You strike the head from the house of the wicked one, / Laying bare the foundation, even to the neck. Selah
You pierce, with his own staves, / The heads of his warriors. / They come out like a whirlwind to scatter me; / Their exultation is as if to devour the poor in secret.
You tread the sea with Your horses, / The heap of mighty waters.
I heard and my body trembled; / My lips quivered at the sound. / Rottenness entered my bones, / And I tremble in my place, / Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress, / When he who attacks us comes up against the people.
For the fig tree will not sprout, / And there will be no yield on the vines; / The labor on the olive tree will fail, / And the fields will make no food; / The flock will be cut off from the fold, / And there will be no herd in the stalls.
Yet I will exult in Jehovah; / I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
Jehovah the Lord is my strength; / And He makes my feet like hinds' feet / And will cause me to walk on my high places. / For the choir director, with my stringed instruments.
