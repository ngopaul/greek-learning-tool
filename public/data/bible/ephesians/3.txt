For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you, the Gentiles--
If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you,
That by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written previously in brief,
By which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ,
Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit,
That in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel,
Of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God which was given to me according to the operation of His power.
To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel
And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things,
In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church,
According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,
In whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in Him.
Therefore I ask you not to faint at my afflictions for your sake, since they are your glory.
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,
Of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named,
That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man,
That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
May be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are
And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us,
To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen.
