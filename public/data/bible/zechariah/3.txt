Then He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of Jehovah and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.
And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the Angel.
And He answered and spoke to those standing before Him, saying, Remove the filthy garments from him. Then He said to him, See, I hereby make your iniquity pass from you and clothe you with stately robes.
And He said, Let them put a clean turban upon his head. And they put the clean turban upon his head and clothed him with garments while the Angel of Jehovah stood by.
And the Angel of Jehovah testified to Joshua, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of hosts, If you will walk in My ways and if you will keep My charge, then you will both judge My house and keep My courts, and I will grant you to walk among these standing here.
Hear then, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you--for they are men of symbol--for I am about to bring forth My servant, the shoot.
For here is the stone that I have set before Joshua--upon one stone are seven eyes. I will engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
In that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, each of you will invite his neighbor to come under the vine and under the fig tree.
