Then I lifted up my eyes again and I saw, and there was a flying scroll.
And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see a flying scroll, its length twenty cubits and its breadth ten cubits.
Then he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of all the land; for everyone who steals will be purged according to what is on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged according to what is on the other side.
I will cause it to go forth, declares Jehovah of hosts; and it will enter the house of him who steals and the house of him who swears falsely by My name; and it will lodge overnight within his house and consume it, both with its timbers and its stones.
Then the angel who spoke with me went forth and said to me, Lift up now your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah vessel that goes forth; and he said, This is their appearance in all the land;
(Then a lead cover was lifted up) and this is a woman sitting within the ephah vessel.
Then he said, This is Wickedness. And he threw her down into the midst of the ephah vessel and threw the lead weight over its opening.
Then I lifted up my eyes and I looked, and there were two women going forth, and the wind was in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the ephah vessel between the earth and the heavens.
And I said to the angel who spoke with me, Where are they taking the ephah vessel?
And he said to me, To build a house for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place.
