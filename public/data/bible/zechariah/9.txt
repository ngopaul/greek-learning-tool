The burden of the word of Jehovah against the land of Hadrach, / And Damascus will be its resting place / (For Jehovah has an eye on man, / Especially on the tribes of Israel),
And Hamath also, which borders on it; / Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.
For Tyre built herself a stronghold / And heaped up silver like dust / And gold like the mire of the streets.
The Lord is about to take possession of her, / And He will strike her might in the sea, / And she will be consumed with fire.
Ashkelon will see it and be afraid; / Gaza also, and it will writhe much in anguish; / And Ekron, for her expectation will have been confounded. / And the king will perish from Gaza, / And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
And a mixed race will dwell in Ashdod, / And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
And I will remove his blood from his mouth / And his detestable things from between his teeth; / And he also will remain unto our God; / And he will be like a leader in Judah, / And Ekron will be like a Jebusite.
And I will encamp around My house because of an army, / Because of him who passes by and returns; / And no oppressor will pass over them anymore; / For now I see with My eyes.
Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; / Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! / Now your King comes to you. / He is righteous and bears salvation, / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey.
And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim / And the horse from Jerusalem, / And the battle bow will be cut off; / And He will speak peace unto the nations, / And His dominion will be from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth.
As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant, / I have released your captives from the pit, where there is no water.
Turn to the stronghold, O prisoners with hope. / This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.
For I will bend Judah for Myself, / And I will fill a bow with Ephraim; / And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, / Against your sons, O Javan; / And I will make you like a warrior's sword.
And Jehovah will appear above them, / And His arrow will go forth like lightning; / And the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, / And He will go in the whirlwinds of the south.
Jehovah of hosts will defend them; / And they will devour and trample the sling stones. / And they will drink; they will be noisy as if with wine; / And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, / Like the corners of the altar.
And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of His people, / For they will be like the stones of a crown, sparkling in His land.
For how great is their goodness, and how great their beauty! / Grain will make the young men flourish, / And new wine, the virgins.
