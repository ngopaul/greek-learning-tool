Ask rain of Jehovah / At the time of spring rain, / Of Jehovah who makes the lightning, / And He will give them showers of rain, / To everyone herbage in the field.
For the teraphim have spoken vanity, / And the diviners have seen a lie / And have spoken false dreams; / They comforted in vain. / Therefore the people have wandered like sheep; / They are afflicted because there is no shepherd.
My anger is kindled against the shepherds, / And I will punish the male goats; / For Jehovah of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, / And will make them like His horse of majesty in battle.
From him will come forth the cornerstone, from him the peg, / From him the battle bow, / From him every ruler together.
And they will be as mighty men trampling their enemies / In the mire of the streets in the battle; / And they will fight, for Jehovah is with them; / And the riders of horses will be put to shame.
And I will strengthen the house of Judah, / And I will save the house of Joseph; / And I will bring them back, for I have had compassion on them; / And they will be as though I had not rejected them; / For I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.
And they of Ephraim will be like a mighty man, / And their hearts will rejoice as if with wine; / Indeed, their children will see it and rejoice; / Their heart will exult in Jehovah.
I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them; / And they will multiply as they have multiplied.
And I will sow them among the peoples; and in distant lands they will remember Me; / And they will live with their children and return.
I will also bring them back from the land of Egypt / And gather them out of Assyria; / And to the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them; / And there will not be enough room found for them.
And He will pass through the sea of distress / And strike the waves in the sea, / And all the depths of the Nile will dry up; / And the pride of Assyria will be brought down, / And the scepter of Egypt will depart.
And I will strengthen them in Jehovah, / And they will walk about in His name, / Declares Jehovah.
