If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.
And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
And if I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing.
Love suffers long. Love is kind; it is not jealous. Love does not brag and is not puffed up;
It does not behave unbecomingly and does not seek its own things; it is not provoked and does not take account of evil;
It does not rejoice because of unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;
It covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never falls away. But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless.
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
But when that which is complete comes, that which is in part will be rendered useless.
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; since I have become a man, I have done away with childish things.
For now we see in a mirror obscurely, but at that time face to face; now I know in part, but at that time I will fully know even as also I was fully known.
Now there abide faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.
