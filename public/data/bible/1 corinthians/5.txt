It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication that does not even occur among the Gentiles, that someone has his stepmother.
And you are puffed up? And have you not rather mourned, that the one who has done this deed might be removed from your midst?
For I, on my part, though being absent in the body but present in the spirit, have already judged, as if being present, him who has thus done this,
In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit have been assembled, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.
So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
I wrote to you in my letter not to mingle with fornicators,
But not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and rapacious, or idolaters, since then you would have to go out of the world.
But now I have written to you not to mingle with anyone who is called a brother, if he is a fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man, with such a one not even to eat.
For what have I to do with judging those who are outside the church? Do you not judge those who are within the church?
But those who are outside, God will judge. Remove the evil man from among yourselves.
