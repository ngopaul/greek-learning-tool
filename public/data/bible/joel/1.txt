The word of Jehovah which came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
Hear this, you elders, / And give heed, all you inhabitants of the land. / Has this ever happened in your days, / Or even in the days of your fathers?
Tell your children about it, / And let your children tell their children, / And let their children tell the next generation.
What the cutting locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; / And what the swarming locust has left, the licking locust has eaten; / And what the licking locust has left, the consuming locust has eaten.
Awake, drunkards, and weep; / Howl, all you who drink wine, / Because of the fresh wine; / For it has been cut off from your mouth.
For a nation has come up against My land, / Mighty and without number; / Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, / And it has the cutting teeth of a lioness.
It has made My vine a desolation, / And My fig tree a heap of splinters. / It has stripped it bare and cast it away; / Its branches are white.
Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth / Over the husband of her youth.
The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off / From the house of Jehovah; / The priests, the ministers of Jehovah, mourn.
The field is a waste; / The land mourns, / For the grain is a waste; / The new wine is dried up; / The fresh oil languishes.
Be ashamed, O farmers; / Howl, O vinedressers, / For the wheat and for the barley, / Because the harvest of the field has perished.
The vine is dried up, / And the fig tree languishes, / The pomegranate and the palm and the apple tree--/ All the trees of the field are dried up; / Indeed gladness has withered away / From the children of men.
Gird yourselves and lament, O priests; / Howl, O ministers of the altar. / Come, pass the night in sackcloth, / O ministers of my God. / For the meal offering and the drink offering / Are held back from the house of your God.
Sanctify a fast; / Call a solemn assembly; / Gather the elders / And all the inhabitants of the land / To the house of Jehovah your God; / And cry unto Jehovah.
Alas for the day! / For the day of Jehovah has drawn near, / And as the destruction from the Almighty it will come.
Is not our food / Cut off before our eyes, / Joy and exultation / From the house of our God?
The seeds have shriveled / Under their clods; / The storehouses have been desolated; / The barns have been torn down; / For the grain is dried up.
How the beasts groan! / The herds of cattle are confused, / For they have no pasture; / The flocks of sheep also suffer punishment.
To You, O Jehovah, I cry out; / For fire has devoured / The pastures of the wilderness, / And the flame has set ablaze / All the trees of the field.
The beasts of the field also / Cry to You, / For the waterways / Are dried up, / And fire has devoured / The pastures of the wilderness.
