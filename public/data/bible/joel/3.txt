For indeed, in those days and at that time / When I turn the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
I will gather all the nations / And will bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat; / And I will enter into judgment with them there / Because of My people and My inheritance Israel, / Whom they have scattered among the nations. / And they have divided My land
And have cast lots for My people; / And they have given a boy for a prostitute / And sold a girl for wine to drink.
Indeed then, what are you to Me, Tyre and Sidon / And all the regions of Philistia? / Will you repay Me with a recompense? / But if you recompense Me, / Swiftly, speedily, / I will return your recompense upon your own head.
In that you have taken My silver and My gold, / And have brought My fine precious things into your temples,
And have sold to the children of the Javanim / The children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem, / In order to remove them / Far from their borders;
I will rouse them out of the place / To which you have sold them, / And will return your recompense upon your own head.
And I will sell your sons and your daughters / Into the hand of the children of Judah, / And they will sell them to the Sabeans, / To a nation that is far off, / For Jehovah has spoken.
Proclaim this among the nations: / Prepare the battle; / Rouse the mighty men; / Let all the men of battle / Draw near; let them go up.
Beat your plowshares into swords, / And your pruning knives into spears; / Let the weak say, / I am mighty.
Hurry and come, / All you surrounding nations, / And be gathered. / There cause Your mighty ones to descend, O Jehovah!
Let the nations rouse themselves and come up / To the valley of Jehoshaphat. / For there I will sit to judge / All the surrounding nations.
Send forth the sickle, / For the harvest is ripe; / Come, tread, / For the winepress is full; / The wine vats overflow, / For their evil is great.
Multitudes, multitudes, / In the valley of decision; / For the day of Jehovah has drawn near / In the valley of decision.
The sun and the moon grow dark, / And the stars withdraw their shining.
And Jehovah will roar from Zion, / And from Jerusalem He will utter His voice, / And the heavens and the earth will shake. / But Jehovah will be a shelter to His people / And a stronghold to the children of Israel.
Thus you will know that I am Jehovah your God, / Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. / And Jerusalem will be holy, / And strangers will pass through her no longer.
And in that day / The mountains will drop down fresh wine, / And the hills will flow with milk; / And all the waterways of Judah / Will flow with water, / And a fountain will go forth from the house of Jehovah, / And it will water the valley of Shittim.
Egypt will be a desolation, / And Edom will be a desolate wilderness, / Because of the violence against the children of Judah, / In that they have shed innocent blood in their land.
But Judah will abide forever, / And Jerusalem, from generation to generation;
And I will acquit them of their bloodshed that I had not acquitted them of, / For Jehovah dwells in Zion.
