Blow a trumpet in Zion; / Sound an alarm in My holy mountain; / Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, / For the day of Jehovah comes; / For it draws near:
A day of darkness and gloominess, / A day of clouds and deep darkness, / Like the dawn spread over the mountains--/ A people great and mighty. / There has not been any like them / Since eternity, / And there will not be any more after them, / Even until the years of the generation of the generations.
A fire devours before them, / And after them a flame blazes. / Before them the land is like the garden of Eden, / After them, like a desolate wilderness; / And indeed no one escapes them.
Their appearance is like the appearance of horses; / And as horsemen, so they run.
Like the sound of chariots / Upon the mountaintops they leap, / Like the sound of a flame of fire / That devours the stubble, / Like a mighty people / Set in battle array.
At their presence the peoples writhed in anguish; / All faces became pale.
They run like mighty men; / Like men of battle they climb the wall. / And they march, each in his ways, / And do not break their ranks.
Nor do they crowd each other; / They march, each on his highway. / Though they fall among weapons, / They do not break off their progress.
They rush at the city; / They run against the wall; / They go up into the houses; / In through the windows / They go, like a thief.
The earth quakes before them; / The heavens shake; / The sun and the moon grow dark, / And the stars withdraw their shining.
And Jehovah utters His voice / Before His army, / For His camp is very great, / For He who executes His word is mighty. / For the day of Jehovah is great / And very terrible, / And who can endure it?
Yet even now, / Declares Jehovah, / Turn to Me with all your heart / And with fasting and weeping and mourning;
And rend your hearts, / And not your garments, / And turn to Jehovah your God, / For He is gracious and compassionate, / Long-suffering and abundant in lovingkindness / And repentant of evil.
Who knows whether He will turn and repent / And leave a blessing behind Him, / A meal offering and a drink offering / To Jehovah your God?
Blow a trumpet in Zion; / Sanctify a fast; / Call a solemn assembly;
Gather the people; / Sanctify the congregation; / Assemble the elders; / Gather the children / And those who suck the breasts; / Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, / And the bride from her canopy.
Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, / Weep between the porch and the altar, / And let them say, / Look with pity, O Jehovah, upon Your people; / And do not give Your inheritance over to reproach, / That the nations should rule over them. / Why should they say among the peoples, / Where is their God?
Then Jehovah became jealous for His land, / And He spared His people.
And Jehovah answered and said to His people, / I am about to send you / The grain and the new wine and the fresh oil, / And you will be satisfied with it; / And I will no longer make you / A reproach among the nations,
But the northern army / I will remove far from you; / And I will drive it into a land / Barren and desolate, / With its face toward the eastern sea / And its end toward the western sea. / And its stench will go up, / And its foul smell will go up, / For it has done great things.
Do not fear, O land; / Be glad and rejoice, / For Jehovah has done great things.
Do not fear, O beasts of the field, / For the pastures of the wilderness turn green. / For the tree bears its fruit; / The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.
O children of Zion, / Be glad and rejoice / In Jehovah your God. / For He gives you / The early rain in righteousness, / And He makes the rain come down for you: / The early rain and the late rain / At the beginning of the season.
And the threshing floors will be full of grain, / And the wine vats will overflow with new wine and fresh oil.
And I will restore to you the years / That the swarming locust has eaten, / The licking locust and the consuming locust and the cutting locust, / My great army / That I sent among you.
And you will eat to the full and be satisfied, / And you will praise the name of Jehovah your God, / Who has dealt wondrously with you; / And My people will never be ashamed.
And you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, / And that I am Jehovah your God and there is none else. / And My people will never be ashamed.
And afterward I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh, / And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; / Your old men shall dream dreams; / Your young men shall see visions.
Indeed even upon the male and female slaves / In those days I will pour out My Spirit.
And I will show wonders in the heavens and on earth: / Blood and fire and pillars of smoke.
The sun shall be turned into darkness, / And the moon into blood, / Before the great and terrible / Day of Jehovah comes.
And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah shall be saved; / For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem will be an escape, / As Jehovah has said, / Even for the remnant / Whom Jehovah calls.
