Then again I saw all the acts of oppression that are done under the sun; and indeed, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of the oppressors was power, and they had no comforter.
And I praised the dead, who have already died, more than the living, who are still alive.
And better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
Then I saw all labor and all skill in work, that it is man's jealousy for his neighbor. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
The fool folds his hands together and consumes his own flesh.
Better is a handful with quietness than two hands full with labor and a chasing after wind.
Then again I saw vanity under the sun.
There is one alone and without a second; also he has no son or brother. Yet there is no end to all his labor; moreover his eye is not satisfied with riches. For whom then, he says, do I labor and deprive myself of good? This also is vanity and grievous travail.
Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor;
For if they fall, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls and does not have another to lift him up!
Again, if two lie together, they keep warm. But how can one be warm alone?
And while a man may prevail against the one, the two will withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to be admonished.
For one can come forth from prison to reign, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.
I saw all the living that went about under the sun with the youth, the successor, who stood up in place of him.
There was no end to all the people, to all before whom he stood, yet even those who come after will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
