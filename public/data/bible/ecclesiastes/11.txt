Cast your bread upon the surface of the waters, for you will find it in many days.
Give a portion to seven, and even to eight, for you do not know what calamity will happen on the earth.
If the clouds are full, they pour forth rain on the earth; and whether a tree falls toward the south or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there will it be.
He who watches the wind will not sow, and he who looks at the clouds will not reap.
Just as you do not know what the path of the wind is or how the bones are formed in the mother's womb, so you do not know the work of God, who makes everything.
In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not hold back your hands; for you do not know which will prosper, this one or that, or whether both alike will be good.
The light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.
Indeed if a man should live many years, let him rejoice in all of them; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. All that comes is vanity.
Rejoice, young man, in your childhood, and let your heart be merry in the days of your youth; and walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.
So remove vexation from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh; for childhood and the dawn of life are vanity.
