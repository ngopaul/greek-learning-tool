The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning Edom, / We have heard a report from Jehovah, / And an envoy has been sent among the nations: / Arise, and let us rise up against it for battle.
Indeed I have made you small among the nations; / You are very despised.
The pride of your heart has beguiled you, / O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, / Whose habitation is lofty, / Who says in his heart, / Who will bring me down to the ground?
Though you set yourself on high like the eagle / And though you make your nest among the stars, / I will bring you down from there, / Declares Jehovah.
If thieves came to you, / If spoilers in the night--/ How you would be cut off!--/ Would they not steal only their fill? / If grape gatherers came to you, / Would they not leave gleanings?
How thoroughly searched Esau is! / How sought out his hidden treasures are!
All the men of your confederacy / Have sent you away to the border; / The men who were at peace with you / Have deceived you; they have prevailed against you. / They make your bread / A snare under you. / There is no understanding in him.
Will I not in that day, / Declares Jehovah, / Destroy the wise men from Edom, / And understanding from the mountain of Esau?
And your mighty men will be dismayed, O Teman, / So that each one is cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter.
Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, / Shame will cover you, and you will be cut off forever.
In the day that you stood on the side, / In the day that strangers took his substance captive / And foreigners entered into his gates / And cast lots over Jerusalem, / You also were like one of them.
But do not look to the day of your brother, / To the day of his misfortune; / Neither rejoice concerning the children of Judah / In the day of their destruction, / Nor boast / In the day of distress.
Do not enter the gate of My people / In the day of their calamity; / Do not look, even you, on his affliction / In the day of his calamity, / Nor send forth your hands on his substance / In the day of his calamity.
And do not stand at the crossroads / To cut off those of his who escape, / Nor deliver those of his who survive / In the day of distress.
For the day of Jehovah is near / Upon all the nations: / As you have done, it will be done to you; / Your recompense will return upon your head.
For as you, O people of Judah, have drunk the cup of wrath upon My holy mountain, / All the nations will drink the same continually; / Indeed they will drink and swallow down, / And they will be as though they had not been.
But in Mount Zion / There will be those who have escaped, / And it will be holy. / And the house of Jacob will possess / Their possessions.
And the house of Jacob will be a fire, / And the house of Joseph a flame; / And the house of Esau will be as stubble, / And they will burn among them and devour them; / And there will be no survivor / To the house of Esau, / For Jehovah has spoken.
And those of the south will possess the mountain of Esau, / And those of the lowlands, the Philistines; / Indeed they will possess the field of Ephraim / And the field of Samaria, / And Benjamin will possess Gilead.
And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel, / Who are among the Canaanites, will possess as far as Zarephath; / And the captivity of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, / Will possess the cities of the south.
And saviors will come up on Mount Zion / To judge the mountain of Esau, / And the kingdom will be Jehovah's.
