Let me sing of my Beloved, / A song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard. / My Beloved had a vineyard / On a fertile hill.
And He dug it up and cleared away its stones, / And He planted it with the choicest vine. / Then He built a tower in the middle of it, / And hewed out a wine vat in it. / And He looked for it to produce grapes, / But it produced only wild grapes.
So then, you inhabitants of Jerusalem / And you men of Judah, / Judge between Me / And My vineyard.
What more could I have done for My vineyard / That I have not already done for it? / Why then, when I looked for it to produce grapes, / Did it produce only wild grapes?
And now I will make known to you / What I will now do to My vineyard: / I will remove its hedge, and it will be consumed; / I will break down its wall, and it will become a trampled place.
And I will make it a waste; / It will not be pruned, nor will it be hoed; / But thorns and thistles will come on it. / And I will command the clouds / Not to rain upon it.
For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, / And the men of Judah, the plant of His good pleasure; / And He expected justice, but instead, bloodshed! / He expected righteousness, but instead, an outcry of distress!
Woe to those who join house to house, / Who lay field to field, / Till there is no place left, / And you dwell alone in the midst of the land!
In my ears Jehovah of hosts has sworn: / Many houses shall indeed become desolate; / Great ones and fine ones shall be without inhabitants.
For ten acres of vineyard will produce a mere bath of wine, / And a homer of seed will produce an ephah of grain.
Woe to those who rise early in the morning / That they may run after liquor, / To those who linger into the evening / That wine may inflame them!
Lyre and harp, tambourine and flute, / And wine are the essence of their banquets; / And they do not consider what has been done by Jehovah, / Nor do they regard the work of His hands.
Hence, my people go into exile / For lack of knowledge; / Their nobility become famished men, / And their multitudes, parched with thirst.
Hence, Sheol enlarges its appetite / And opens its mouth wide, without limit, / And Jerusalem's splendor descends, and her din / And her uproar and the jubilant within her.
Thus the ordinary man is humbled, and the man of distinction is abased; / And the eyes of the haughty are abased;
But Jehovah of hosts is exalted in judgment, / And the holy God shows Himself holy in righteousness.
Then lambs will graze there as in their pasture, / And strangers will eat the wastelands of fat men.
Woe to those who draw iniquity with ropes of vanity, / And sin as with cart ropes;
Who say, He should hurry up; / He should hasten His work, / So that we may see it; / And the counsel of the Holy One of Israel / Should draw near and happen, / So that we may know it!
Woe to those who call evil good, / And good evil; / Who put darkness for light, / And light for darkness; / Who put bitter for sweet, / And sweet for bitter!
Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, / And prudent in their own sight!
Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine, / And men of valor in mixing liquor;
Who acquit the criminal as a result of a bribe, / But refuse righteousness to the righteous!
Therefore as a tongue of fire consumes the stubble, / And the chaff sinks in flames, / Their root will be like decay, / And their bud will disappear like dust; / For they have rejected the instruction of Jehovah of hosts / And despised the speaking of the Holy One of Israel.
For this reason the anger of Jehovah burns against His people, / And He stretches out His hand over them and strikes them. / And the mountains quake, and their corpses are / Like garbage in the middle of the street. / In spite of all this His anger is not turned away; / Rather, His hand is still stretched out.
He also lifts up a standard to a distant nation, / And whistles to it from the ends of the earth; / And indeed it comes with swift speed.
None of them is weary, and none stumbles among them; / No one slumbers or sleeps; / And their belts are not loosened at their waists, / Nor are their sandal thongs broken.
The arrows of these are sharpened, / And all their bows are drawn; / The hooves of their horses are considered to be like flint, / And their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.
Their roar is like a lion's, / And they roar like young lions; / When they growl and seize prey, / They carry it away safe, and there is none to rescue it.
And they will growl over it in that day, / Like the roaring of the sea. / When one will look upon the land, indeed, there will be darkness and distress, / And the light will be darkened with its clouds.
