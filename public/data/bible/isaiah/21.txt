The burden concerning the wilderness of the sea: Like storm winds / In the Negev passing through, / It comes from the wilderness / From an awesome land.
A harsh vision / Has been announced to me; / The unfaithful one deals unfaithfully, / And the destroyer destroys. / Go up, Elam; / Lay siege, Media; / I have put an end / To all her groaning.
Therefore my loins / Are full of anguish; / Pangs have taken hold of me / Like the pangs of a woman in labor. / I am bent over at the hearing of it; / I am terrified at the seeing of it.
My heart reels; / Shuddering overwhelms me. / The twilight that I love / Has become a source of trembling to me.
Setting the table! / Spreading out the rug! / Eating! Drinking! / Rise, princes; / Oil the shields.
For thus says / The Lord to me, / Go, set a watchman; / Let him report what he sees.
And he saw riders, / A team of horsemen; / Riders of donkeys, / Riders of camels; / And he attends with attention, / With much attention.
And he calls out like a lion: / On the watchtower, Lord, / I stand continually by day; / At my guardpost / I am stationed / Every night.
And now there come / Riding men, / A team of horsemen. / And one answers and says, / Fallen, fallen is Babylon! / And all the idols of her gods / Has He shattered to the ground.
My threshed ones, / And the son of the threshing floor! / What I have heard / From Jehovah of hosts, / The God of Israel, / I have declared to you.
The burden concerning Dumah: / Someone is calling to me from Seir: / Guard, what remains of the night? / Guard, what remains of the night?
The guard says, / Morning is coming, / But so also is night; / If you will ask, ask; / Return, come.
The burden against Arabia: / In the thicket of Arabia you must spend the night, / You nomad clans of the Dedanim.
They bring water / To meet the thirsty; / The inhabitants of the land of Tema / Meet with bread those who flee;
For they flee from swords--/ From the drawn sword, / From the bent bow, / And from the harshness of battle.
For thus has the Lord said to me, Within a year, like a wage worker's year, all the glory of Kedar will end,
And the remainder of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, will be few; for Jehovah the God of Israel has spoken.
