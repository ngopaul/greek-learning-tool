Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim / And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, / Which is at the head of the fat valley of those who are overcome by wine.
Indeed the Lord has someone strong and mighty; / As a hailstorm and a tempest of destruction, / As a storm of mighty overflowing waters, / He will cast down to the earth with His hand.
The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim / Will be trodden under foot;
And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, / Which is at the head of the fat valley, / Will be like the first-ripe fig before the summer, / Which when someone looks upon it he sees it, / And in an instant it is in his hand, and he swallows it up.
In that day Jehovah of hosts / Will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of His people,
And a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment / And strength to those who turn away the battle at the gate.
But these also reel with wine / And stagger from liquor: / The priest and the prophet reel from liquor; / They are swallowed up with wine; / They stagger from liquor, / They reel in their visions, / They totter in their judgments.
For all the tables are full of vomit and filth; / There is no place clean.
Whom will he teach knowledge? / And whom will he instruct with the report? / Those weaned from milk? / Those drawn from the breasts?
For his words are: Rule upon rule, rule upon rule; / Line upon line, line upon line; / Here a little, there a little.
For with stammering lips / And with a foreign tongue / He will speak to this people,
He who said to them, / This is rest; give rest to the weary; / And, This is repose. / But they would not hear.
Therefore Jehovah's word to them will be: / Rule upon rule, rule upon rule; / Line upon line, line upon line; / Here a little, there a little; / That they may go and stumble backward, / And be broken, snared, and taken.
Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, / You scoffing men, / Who rule this people / Who are in Jerusalem:
Because you have said, We have made / A covenant with death, / And with Sheol / We have made an agreement: / When the overflowing scourge passes through, / It will not come upon us; / For we have made falsehood our refuge / And have hidden ourselves in deception.
Therefore thus says / The Lord Jehovah: / Indeed I lay a stone in Zion as a foundation, / A tested stone, / A precious cornerstone as a foundation firmly established; / He who believes will not hasten away.
And I will make justice the line / And righteousness the plummet; / And the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, / And the waters will overflow the secret place.
And your covenant with death will be annulled, / And your agreement with Sheol will not stand; / When the overflowing scourge passes through, / You will be a trampling ground to it.
As often as it passes through, / It will take hold of you. / For morning by morning it will pass through, / By day and by night; / And it will be nothing but terror / To understand the report of it.
For the bed is too short for a man to stretch on, / And the sheet is too narrow for him to wrap himself in.
For Jehovah will rise as on Mount Perazim, / He will be agitated as in the valley of Gibeon, / To do His deed, His strange deed, / And to do His work, His most different work.
Now therefore do not be mockers, / Lest your fetters become stronger; / For I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Of complete and decisive destruction upon the whole earth.
Hearken and hear my voice; / Attend and hear my speech.
Does the plowman plow all day long to sow his seed? / Does he open and harrow his ground continually?
Does he not, once he levels the surface, / Scatter dill and broadcast cummin, / And put the wheat in rows and the barley in its appointed place / And the rye where it belongs?
For his God instructs him toward such discretion / And teaches him so.
For dill is not threshed with a sharp tool, / Nor is the cart wheel turned upon the cummin; / But dill is beaten out with a rod, / And cummin with a stick.
Bread grains are ground, / Yet one does not thresh and thresh forever. / And once the wheel of his cart and his horses drive over it, / One does not grind it.
This also comes forth from Jehovah of hosts, / He who makes His counsel extraordinary and His sound wisdom great.
