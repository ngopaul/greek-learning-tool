I let Myself be inquired of by those who did not ask for Me, / And found by those who did not seek Me. / I said, Here I am; here I am; / To a nation that was not called by My name.
I have stretched out My hands all day long / To a rebellious people, / Who walk in a way that is not good, / After their own thoughts;
A people who provoke Me to anger / To My face continually, / Who sacrifice in gardens / And burn incense upon the bricks;
Who sit among the graves / And lodge overnight in the secret places; / Who eat swine's flesh / And the broth of abominations in their pots;
Who say, Keep to yourself, / Do not come near me; for I am holier than you. / These are smoke in My nose, / A fire that burns all day.
It is written here before Me: / I will not keep silent without first recompensing; / And I will recompense, into their bosom,
Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together, / Says Jehovah, / Who have burned incense upon the mountains / And have scorned Me upon the hills; / Therefore I will measure their work first / Into their bosom.
Thus says Jehovah, / As the new wine is found in the cluster, / And someone says, Do not destroy it, / For there is a blessing in it; / So will I do for My servants' sake, / In order not to destroy them all.
And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, / And out of Judah one who will possess My mountains; / And My chosen ones will possess it, / And My servants will dwell there.
And Sharon will be an abode for the flock, / And the valley of Achor a resting place for the herd, / For My people who have sought Me.
But you who forsake Jehovah, / Who forget My holy mountain, / Who prepare a table to Fortune / And fill vessels with drink offerings to Destiny,
I will destine you to the sword, / And you all will bow down to the slaughter; / Because I called you, but you did not answer; / I spoke, but you did not listen; / But you did evil in My sight / And chose that in which I did not delight.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, / Indeed, My servants shall eat, / But you shall hunger; / Indeed, My servants shall drink, / But you shall thirst; / Indeed, My servants shall rejoice, / But you shall be put to shame;
Indeed, My servants shall give a ringing shout / Because of a heart of joy, / But you shall cry out / Because of a heart of pain, / And because of a broken spirit you shall wail.
And you will leave your name as a curse to My chosen ones, / And the Lord Jehovah will slay you; / And He will call His servants by another name,
So that he who blesses himself in the earth / Will bless himself in the God of faithfulness, / And he who swears in the earth / Will swear by the God of faithfulness; / Because the former troubles are forgotten / And because they are hidden from My sight.
For I am now creating new heavens / And a new earth, / And the former things will not be remembered, / Nor will they come up in the heart.
But rejoice and exult forever, / In what I create, / For I am now creating Jerusalem as an exultation / And her people as a rejoicing.
And I will exult in Jerusalem / And rejoice in My people; / And there will no longer be heard in her / The voice of weeping and the voice of crying.
There will no longer be in her / An infant who reaches the age of only a few days / Nor an old man who does not fill up his days; / For the lad will die at a hundred years of age, / And the sinner, being a hundred years of age, will be cursed.
And they will build houses and inhabit them, / And they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
They will not build and another inhabit; / They will not plant and another eat; / For like the days of a tree are the days of My people, / And My chosen ones will enjoy the work of their hands to the full;
They will not labor in vain, / Nor bear children unto turmoil; / For they are the seed of those blessed of Jehovah, / And their offspring with them.
And it will be that before they call, I will answer; / Even while they are speaking, I will hear.
The wolf and the lamb will feed as one, / And the lion will eat straw like the ox, / And dust will be the serpent's food; / They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.
