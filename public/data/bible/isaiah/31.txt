Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help; / They rely on horses / And trust in chariots because they are many / And in horsemen because they are very strong; / But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, / Nor seek Jehovah!
But He also is wise and will bring ill upon them; / And He does not turn back His words, / But will rise up against the house of evildoers / And against the help of the workers of iniquity.
The Egyptians are mere men and not God, / And their horses are mere flesh and not spirit; / Thus Jehovah will stretch out His hand, / And he who helps will stumble and he who is helped will fall, / And all of them will be consumed together.
For Jehovah has spoken thus to me, / As the lion or the lion cub / Roars over its prey / And because of it a crowd of shepherds / Is called out, / But it is not frightened by their voice, / Nor overcome by their noise; / So Jehovah of hosts will descend / To wage war on Mount Zion and on its hill.
Like flying birds / So Jehovah of hosts will protect Jerusalem; / He will protect and deliver it; / He will pass over and rescue it.
Return to Him from whom men have deeply revolted, O children of Israel.
For in that day each man will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you as a sin.
And the Assyrian will fall by the sword not of a man, / And the sword not of man will devour him. / Thus he will flee from a sword, / And his young men will be forced into labor.
And his rock will pass away in terror, / And his princes will be dismayed by the standard, / Declares Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion / And whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
