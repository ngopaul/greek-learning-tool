The burden concerning Damascus: See, Damascus--turned from being a city, / It will become a heap of ruin.
The cities of Aroer will be forsaken; / They will be for flocks / That lie down with no one to frighten them.
And fortified cities will cease to be in Ephraim, / As well as the kingdom in Damascus; / And the remnant of Syria / Will be like the glory of the children of Israel, / Declares Jehovah of hosts.
In that day the glory of Jacob will fade, / And the fat of his flesh will become lean.
And it will be as when the reaper gathers the standing grain, / And his arms reap the ears; / And it will be as when one gleans the ears / In the valley of Rephaim.
Yet gleanings will be left in it, / Like at the shaking of an olive tree--/ Two or three fruit at the very top, / Four or five in the boughs of the fruiting tree--/ Declares Jehovah the God of Israel.
In that day man will look to his Maker, / And his eyes will behold the Holy One of Israel.
And he will not look to the altars, the works of his hands; / And what his fingers have made he will not regard, / That is, the Asherahs and the images to the sun.
In that day his cities of protection will be / Like abandoned places of the forest and like the mountaintop / Which was abandoned before the children of Israel; / And there will be desolation.
For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, / And the Rock of your stronghold you have not remembered. / Therefore you plant plants of delight / And set them with plant cuttings to a strange god.
On the day that you plant them you fence them in carefully, / And in the morning you bring your seed to blossom; / But the harvest is a heap on a day of sickness / And incurable pain.
Woe! The roar of many peoples, / Who roar like the roaring of the seas; / The din of nations, / Who crash like the crashing of mighty waters!
The nations crash like the crashing of many waters. / But He will rebuke them; / And they will flee far away, / And will be chased like mountain chaff before the wind / And like a whirlwind of dust before storm wind.
At evening time, indeed, there is calamity; / Before the morning they are no more. / This is the portion of those who plunder us, / And the allotment of those who take us as spoil.
