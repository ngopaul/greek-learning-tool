And you will say in that day, / I will praise You, O Jehovah. You were angry with me, / But Your anger has turned and You have consoled me.
God is now my salvation; / I will trust and not dread; / For Jah Jehovah is my strength and song, / And He has become my salvation.
Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation,
And you will say in that day, / Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name! / Make His deeds known among the peoples; / Remind them that His name is exalted.
Sing psalms to Jehovah, for He has done something majestic! / Let it be made known in all the earth!
Cry out and give a ringing shout, O inhabitant of Zion, / For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.
