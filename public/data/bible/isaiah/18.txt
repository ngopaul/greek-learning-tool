Woe to the land of the whirring of wings, / Which is beyond the rivers of Cush,
The land that sends envoys on the sea, / Even in papyrus vessels upon the surface of the water. / Go, swift messengers, / To a nation tall and smooth of skin, / To a people feared from there and beyond, / A nation of command upon command and of treading down others, / Whose land the rivers cut through.
All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers on the earth, / When the standard is raised on the mountains, you will see it; / And when the horn is blown, you will hear it.
For thus has Jehovah spoken to me, / I will be quiet and observe in My lodging place, / Like glowing heat in the sunshine, / Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
For before the harvest, when the bud is full / And the flower becomes the ripening grape, / He will cut off the sprigs with pruning knives, / And the tendrils He will remove and cut away.
They will be left together for the mountain birds / And for the beasts of the earth. / And the birds will spend summer on them, / And all the beasts of the earth will spend harvest time on them.
At that time a gift will be brought to Jehovah of hosts from a people tall and smooth of skin, even from a people feared from there and beyond, a nation of command upon command and of treading down others, whose land the rivers cut through, unto the place of the name of Jehovah of hosts, Mount Zion.
