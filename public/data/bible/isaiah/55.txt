Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; / And you who have no money, / Come, buy and eat; / Yes, come, buy wine and milk / Without money and without price.
Why do you spend money for what is not bread, / And the result of your labor for what does not satisfy? / Hear Me attentively, and eat what is good, / And let your soul delight itself in fatness.
Incline your ear and come to Me; / Hear, so that your soul may live; / And I will make an eternal covenant with you, / Even the sure mercies shown to David.
Indeed, I have given Him as a Witness to the peoples, / A Leader and a Commander to the peoples.
Indeed, you will call a nation that you do not know, / And a nation that does not know you will run to you, / Because of Jehovah your God, even the Holy One of Israel, / For He has glorified you.
Seek Jehovah while He may be found; / Call upon Him while He is near.
Let the wicked forsake his way, / And the evildoer, his thoughts; / And let him return to Jehovah, and He will have compassion on him; / And to our God, for He will pardon abundantly.
For My thoughts are not your thoughts, / And your ways are not My ways, declares Jehovah.
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, / So My ways are higher than your ways, / And My thoughts higher than your thoughts.
For just as the rain comes down / And the snow from heaven, / And does not return there, / Until it waters the earth / And makes it bear and sprout forth, / That it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; / It will not return to Me vainly, / But it will accomplish what I delight in, / And it will prosper in the matter to which I have sent it.
For you will go out with rejoicing, / And you will be led forth in peace; / The mountains and the hills / Will break forth before you with a ringing shout, / And all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
In place of the thornbush, the fir tree will come up; / In place of the brier, the myrtle will come up; / And it will be to Jehovah as a name, / As an eternal sign that will not be cut off.
