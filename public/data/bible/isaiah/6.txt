In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple.
Seraphim hovered over Him, each having six wings: With two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
And one called to the other, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts; / The whole earth is filled with His glory.
And the foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
Then I said, Woe is me, for I am finished! / For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell; / Yet my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.
Then one of the seraphim flew to me with an ember in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.
And he touched my mouth with it and said, Now that this has touched your lips, / Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged.
Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us? And I said, Here am I; send me.
And He said, Go and say to this people, Hear indeed, but do not perceive; / And see indeed, but do not understand.
Make the heart of this people numb; / Dull their ears, / And seal their eyes; / Lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, / And their heart perceive and return, and they are healed.
And I said, For how long, Lord? And He said, Until cities lie devastated, / Without inhabitants, / And houses are without people, / And the land is devastated and a waste;
And Jehovah has sent men far away from it, / And desolate places abound in the midst of the land.
But there will still be a tenth part in it; / And it in turn is to be burned / Like a terebinth or an oak, / Whose stump remains after its felling; / Its stump will be a holy seed.
