Thus says Jehovah to His anointed, / To Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, / To subdue the nations before him; / And I will loosen the loins of kings; / To open before him double doors / So that the gates will not be shut:
I will go before you / And make level the rough places; / I will shatter the doors of bronze / And cut through the bars of iron,
And give to you the treasures of darkness / And the hidden riches of secret places, / That you may know that I am Jehovah, who calls you by your name, / The God of Israel.
For the sake of My servant, Jacob, / And Israel, My chosen one, / I have also called you by your name; / I have surnamed you, although you do not know Me.
I am Jehovah and there is no one else; / Besides Me there is no God; / I girded you, although you do not know Me;
That they might know from the rising of the sun and from the west / That there is no one besides Me. / I am Jehovah and there is no one else;
He who forms the light and creates darkness, / He who makes peace and creates evil, / I am Jehovah who makes all these things.
Drip down, O heavens, from above, / And let the clouds flow down righteousness; / Let the earth open / And bring forth salvation and righteousness; / Let them spring forth together; / I, Jehovah, have created it.
Woe to him who strives with the One who formed him--/ A potsherd among the earthen potsherds. / Shall the clay say to the One who forms it, What are You making? / And your work say, He has no hands?
Woe to him who says to his father, What are you begetting? / Or to a woman, What are you bringing forth?
Thus says Jehovah, / The Holy One of Israel and the One who formed him, / Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons, / And concerning the work of My hands, command Me.
I have made the earth, / And created man upon it; / My own hands stretched out the heavens, / And I commanded all of their host.
I raised him up in righteousness, / And will make straight all his ways; / He will build My city, / And send away My captives, / Neither for a price nor for a reward, / Says Jehovah of hosts.
Thus says Jehovah, / The wealth of Egypt, and the merchandise of Cush, / And the Sabeans, men of stature, / Will pass to you and will be yours. / They will walk behind you; they will come over in chains / And bow down to you and petition you, saying, / Surely God is with you, and there is no one else; / There is no other God.
Surely You are a God who hides Himself, / O God of Israel, the Savior.
All of them will be ashamed and even confounded; / Those who make idols go in confusion together.
Israel has been saved by Jehovah / With an eternal salvation; / You will not be ashamed or confounded / Forever and ever.
For thus says Jehovah, / Who created the heavens--/ He is the God / Who formed the earth and made it; / He established it; / He did not create it waste, / But He formed it to be inhabited: / I am Jehovah and there is no one else;
I have not spoken in secret, / In a dark place of the earth; / I did not say to the seed of Jacob, / Seek Me in vain. / I, Jehovah, speak righteousness, / Declaring things that are right.
Gather yourselves together and come; / Draw near together, / You who have escaped from the nations. / Those who set up their wooden idol / And pray unto a god who cannot save / Have no knowledge.
Declare and present your case; / Indeed, let them take counsel together. / Who related this long ago; / Who declared it from that time? / Was it not I, Jehovah? / And there is no other God besides Me; / A righteous God and Savior, / And there is no one except Me.
Turn to Me and be saved, / All the ends of the earth, / For I am God and there is no one else.
I have sworn by Myself; / A word has gone out of My mouth in righteousness / And will not return, / That every knee shall bow to Me, / And every tongue shall swear.
It shall be said of Me, Only in Jehovah / Is there righteousness and strength. / To Him shall men come, / And all those who are burning in anger against Him shall be ashamed.
In Jehovah all the seed of Israel / Shall be justified and shall glory.
