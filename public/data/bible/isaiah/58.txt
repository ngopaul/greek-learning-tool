Cry loudly; do not hold back; / Raise your voice like a trumpet, / And declare to My people their transgression / And to the house of Jacob their sins.
Yet they seek Me day by day / And take delight in knowing My ways, / Like a nation that has done righteousness / And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God. / They ask Me for righteous judgments; / They take delight in approaching God.
Why have we fasted, and yet You do not see? / Why have we afflicted our soul, and yet You do not acknowledge? / Indeed, on the day of your fast you find delight, / And oppress all your laborers.
Indeed, you fast for contention and strife, / And to strike with a fist of wickedness; / You do not fast, in the way you do today, / To make your voice heard on high.
Is such the fast that I choose, / The day when a man afflicts his soul? / Is it for bowing his head like a rush / And for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as his bed? / Will you call this a fast, / And an acceptable day to Jehovah?
Is this not the fast that I choose, / To loosen the bonds of wickedness, / To undo the bands of the yoke, / And to let the oppressed go free, / And to break every yoke?
Is it not to divide your bread to the hungry, / And to bring the wandering poor home; / When you see the naked, to cover him, / And not to hide yourself from your own flesh?
Then your light will break forth like the dawn, / And your recovery will speedily spring forth. / And your righteousness will go before you; / The glory of Jehovah will guard you from behind.
Then you will call, and Jehovah will answer; / You will cry out, and He will say, Here I am. If you remove the yoke from your midst, / The pointing of the finger and the speaking of wickedness,
And if you draw out your soul to the hungry / And satisfy the desires of the afflicted; / Then your light will rise in the darkness, / And your gloom will be like midday;
And Jehovah will guide you continually, / And satisfy your soul in the dry times, / And strengthen your bones; / And you will be like a watered garden, / And like a spring of water, / Whose waters do not deceive.
And those who are of you will rebuild the ancient ruins; / You will raise up the foundations of generation upon generation; / And you will be called the repairer of the breach, / The restorer of the paths in which to dwell.
If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, / From doing whatever you please on My holy day, / And call the Sabbath a delight, / That which is holy to Jehovah honorable, / And honor it, not doing your own ways, / Nor finding your own pleasure and speaking idle words;
Then you will have delight in Jehovah; / And I will cause you to ride upon the heights of the earth, / And I will feed you with the inheritance of Jacob your father; / For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.
