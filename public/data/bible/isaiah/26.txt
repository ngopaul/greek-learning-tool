In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; / He will set up salvation as walls and a rampart.
Open the gates / So that the righteous nation may enter, / They who maintain faithfulness.
You will keep the steadfast of mind / In perfect peace / Because he trusts in You.
Trust in Jehovah forever and ever, / For in Jah Jehovah we have an eternal rock.
For He has brought down those who dwell on high, / The lofty city; / He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground; / He casts it into the dust.
The foot will trample it, the foot of the poor, / The steps of the weak.
The path of the righteous is smoothness; / O You who are upright, You make the path of the righteous level.
Indeed in the path of Your judgments, / O Jehovah, we have waited for You. / Your name, that is, Your memorial, / Is the desire of our soul.
My soul desires You in the night; / Indeed my spirit within me seeks You at the dawn; / For when Your judgments are in the earth, / The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
Though the wicked is shown grace, / He does not learn righteousness; / In the land of straightforwardness he deals unjustly / And does not perceive the majesty of Jehovah.
O Jehovah, Your hand is lifted up, / But they do not see it. / They will see Your zeal for the people and will be put to shame; / Indeed fire will devour Your adversaries.
O Jehovah, You will ordain peace for us, / For You have also performed all our works for us.
O Jehovah our God, other lords besides You have been master to us, / But through You alone do we mention Your name.
The dead will not live, / The deceased will not rise; / Therefore You have visited and destroyed them, / And You have caused all memory of them to perish.
You have increased the nation, O Jehovah; / You have increased the nation--You are glorified; / You have far extended all the edges of the land.
O Jehovah, in distress they sought You; / They whispered out a prayer, for Your chastening was upon them.
As a pregnant woman draws near to giving birth, / She writhes and cries out in her pain; / So we have been before You, O Jehovah.
We were pregnant; we writhed; we gave birth, as it were, to wind. / We have not accomplished deliverance for the earth, / Nor have the inhabitants of the world been born.
Your dead will live; my corpses will rise. / Awake and give a ringing shout, you who dwell in dust, / For your dew is like the dew of the dawn, / And the earth will bring forth the deceased.
Come, my people, enter your rooms, / And shut your doors behind you; / Hide for a short moment / Until the indignation has passed;
For Jehovah is now coming forth from His place / To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; / And the earth will reveal her bloodshed / And will no longer conceal her slain.
