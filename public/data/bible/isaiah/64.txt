Oh that You would rend the heavens, that You would come down--/ That the mountains would shake at Your presence--
Like fire that kindles brushwood, / Like fire that causes water to boil, / To make Your name known to Your adversaries, / That the nations may tremble at Your presence!
When You did awesome things that we did not expect, / You came down, the mountains shook at Your presence.
For from of old, men have not heard, / Nor perceived with the ear, / Neither has eye seen a God besides You, / Who acts for him who waits for Him.
You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness, / Those who remember You in Your ways. / Yes, You were angry, for we sinned; / We have been in them for a long time, and shall we be saved?
For all of us became like him who is unclean, / And all our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment; / And we all wither like a leaf, / And our iniquities, like the wind, carry us away.
And there is no one who calls upon Your name, / Who stirs himself up to lay hold of You; / For You have hidden Your face from us / And have consumed us by our iniquities.
But now, Jehovah, You are our Father; / We are the clay; and You, our Potter; / And all of us are the work of Your hand.
Do not be angry to an extreme, O Jehovah, / Neither remember iniquity forever; / Look now, we pray: We all are Your people.
Your holy cities have become a wilderness; / Zion is a wilderness, / Jerusalem a desolation.
Our holy and beautiful house, / Where our fathers praised You, / Is burned with fire; / And all the things that we delighted in have become a ruin.
Will You restrain Yourself from these, O Jehovah? / Will You keep silent and afflict us to an extreme?
