The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
But in the last days / The mountain of the house of Jehovah will be established / On the top of the mountains; / And it will be lifted up above the hills; / And all the nations will stream to it,
And many peoples will come and say, / Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, / To the house of the God of Jacob, / That He may instruct us in His ways, / And that we may walk in His paths. / For from Zion will go forth instruction, / And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;
And He will judge between the nations, / And will decide matters for many peoples. / And they will beat their swords into plowshares, / And their spears into pruning knives; / Nation will not lift up sword against nation, / Nor will they learn war anymore.
House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.
For You have abandoned Your people, / The house of Jacob; / Because they are full of customs from the east, / And they are soothsayers like the Philistines, / And they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.
Their land is full of silver and gold, / And their treasures are limitless; / Their land is also full of horses, / And their chariots are limitless.
And their land is full of idols; / They bow down to the work of their hands, / To that which their fingers have made.
Thus the ordinary man is humbled, and the man of distinction is abased--/ But do not forgive them.
Enter into the rock, / And hide in the dust, / From the dread of Jehovah, / And from the splendor of His majesty.
Man's haughty look will be abased, / And the loftiness of men will be humbled; / But Jehovah alone will be exalted / In that day.
For Jehovah of hosts will have a day / Over everything proud and lofty, / And over everything lifted up that it may be abased;
Over all the cedars of Lebanon, / Which are lofty and lifted up, / And over all the oaks of Bashan;
Over all the lofty mountains, / And over all the hills that are lifted up;
Over every high tower, / And over every fortified wall;
Over all the ships of Tarshish, / And over all their pleasant artifacts.
And the haughtiness of the ordinary man will be humbled, / And the loftiness of the men of distinction will be abased; / But Jehovah alone will be exalted / In that day.
And the idols will vanish completely.
And men will go into caves in the rocks / And into holes in the dust, / From the dread of Jehovah, / And from the splendor of His majesty, / When He arises to make the earth tremble.
In that day a man will cast / His idols of silver and his idols of gold, / Which they made for themselves to bow down to, / To the moles and to the bats,
So that they may go into the crevices of the rocks / And into the clefts of the cliffs, / From the dread of Jehovah, / And from the splendor of His majesty, / When He arises to make the earth tremble.
Stop regarding man, / Whose life breath is in his nostrils. / For of what value is he considered to be?
