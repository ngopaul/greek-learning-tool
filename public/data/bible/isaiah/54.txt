Give a ringing shout, O barren one, you who have not borne; / Break forth into joyful shouting and cry out, you who have not been in labor; / For more numerous are the children of the desolate one / Than the children of the married woman, says Jehovah.
Enlarge your tent site, / Let them stretch out the curtains of your habitations; / Spare not; / Lengthen your cords, / And strengthen your pegs;
For on the right and on the left you will break open, / And your seed will possess the nations / And will cause the desolate cities to be inhabited.
Fear not, for you will not be put to shame; / Neither be humiliated, for you will not be ashamed; / But you will forget the shame of your youth, / And the reproach of your widowhood you will no longer remember.
For your Maker is your Husband; / Jehovah of hosts is His name. / And the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; / He is called the God of all the earth.
For Jehovah has called you, / Like a wife who has been forsaken and is grieved in spirit, / Even like a wife of one's youth when she has been rejected, / Says your God.
For a short moment I forsook you, / But with great compassion I will gather you.
In a flood of wrath I hid / My face from you for a moment, / But with eternal lovingkindness I will have mercy on you, / Says Jehovah your Redeemer.
For this is like the waters of Noah to Me, / When I swore that the waters of Noah / Would not overflow the earth ever again; / So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, / Nor will I rebuke you.
For the mountains may depart, / And the hills may shake, / But My lovingkindness will not depart from you, / And My covenant of peace will not shake, / Says Jehovah who has compassion on you.
O afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted, / Indeed, I Myself will lay down your stones in dark mortar, / And will lay your foundations with sapphires.
And I will make your battlements of rubies, / And your gates of carbuncles, / And all your borders will be precious stones.
And all your children will be taught of Jehovah, / And the peace of your children will be great.
In righteousness you will be established; / You will be far from oppression, for you will not fear, / And far from terror, for it will not come near you.
Indeed, they may fiercely attack you, but it is not of Me; / Whoever attacks you will fall because of you.
Indeed, it is I who have created the blacksmith / Who blows the fire of the coals, / And brings out a weapon for its work; / And it is I who have created the destroyer to ruin.
No weapon that is formed against you will prosper, / And every tongue that rises up to judge you, you will condemn. / This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, / And their righteousness which is of Me, declares Jehovah.
