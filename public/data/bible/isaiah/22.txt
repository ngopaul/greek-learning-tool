The burden concerning the valley of vision: What then troubles you / That all have gone up to the housetops?
You who are full of noise, you tumultuous city, / You exultant town, / Your slain were not slain with the sword, / Nor are they dead because of battle.
All your rulers have fled together; / Apart from the bow they have been captured. / All of you who were found have been captured together, / Though they had fled far away.
Therefore I said, Look away from me! / Let me weep bitterly. / Do not hasten to comfort me / About the destruction of the daughter of my people.
For there is a day of turmoil and trampling down and confusion / With the Lord Jehovah of hosts / In the valley of vision, a breaking down of walls / And crying to the mountains.
And Elam took up the quiver, / With chariots of men and horsemen; / And Kir uncovered the shield.
Then your choicest valleys / Were full of chariots, / And the horsemen firmly fixed themselves at the gate;
And he removed the covering of Judah. / And you looked in that day / To the weapons of the Forest House,
While the breaches of the city of David / You saw to be many. / So you gathered the water of the lower pool;
And the houses of Jerusalem you counted, / And tore down the houses to fortify the wall.
Then you made a reservoir between the walls / For the water of the old pool. / But you did not look to its very Maker, / And Him who formed it long ago you did not regard.
Therefore the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Called you in that day / To weeping and to mourning, / To head shaving and to wearing sackcloth.
But now there is gladness and joy, / The slaying of cattle and the slaughtering of sheep, / The eating of meat and the drinking of wine; / Eating and drinking, for tomorrow we die!
But in my ears Jehovah of hosts revealed this: / This iniquity shall by no means be covered for you until you die, / Says the Lord Jehovah of hosts.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah of hosts: / Get up, go to this steward, / To Shebna, who is over the king's house, and say,
What are you doing here, and whom do you have here / That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here, / As he who has hewn a tomb on the heights, / As he who has cut out a resting place for himself in the rock?
Jehovah soon throws you far away, O mighty one, / And He grasps you firmly;
He will wind you up tightly; / Like a ball He will toss you into a wide land. / There you will die; and there the chariots of your glory / Will become the disgrace of the house of your master.
And I will drive you from your position, / And from your standing He will pull you down.
And in that day / I will call to My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
And I will clothe him with your tunic, / And I will strengthen him with your girding sash, / And I will put your dominion into his hand; / And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem / And to the house of Judah.
And I will set the key of the house of David upon his shoulder--/ When he opens, no one will shut; / When he shuts, no one will open.
And I will drive him as a peg into a sure place, / And he will become a throne of glory for his father's house.
And they will hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all the smallest vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.
In that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, the peg driven into the sure place will be removed, even cut away, and it will fall; and the burden that was upon it will be cut down; for Jehovah has spoken.
