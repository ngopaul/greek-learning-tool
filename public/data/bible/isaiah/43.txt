But now thus says Jehovah / Who created you, O Jacob, and who formed you, O Israel: / Do not fear, because I have redeemed you; / I have called you by your name; you are Mine.
When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, / And through the rivers, they will not flow over you. / And when you walk through the fire, you will not be burned, / And the flame will not consume you.
Because I am Jehovah your God, / The Holy One of Israel, your Savior, / I have given Egypt as your ransom, / Cush and Seba instead of you.
Since you were precious in My eyes, / Since you have been honorable and I have loved you, / I will give up men in your place, / And peoples in exchange for your life.
Do not fear, because I am with you; / I will bring your seed from the east, / And gather you from the west.
I will say to the north, Give them up, / And to the south, Do not keep them back. / Bring My sons from afar, / And My daughters from the end of the earth,
Everyone who is called by My name, / Whom I have created, formed, and even made for My glory.
Bring out the people who are blind yet have eyes, / And those who are deaf yet have ears.
Let all the nations be gathered together, / And let the peoples assemble. / Who among them can declare this / And relate to us the former things? / Let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified, / And let them hear and say, It is true.
You are My witnesses, declares Jehovah, / And My servant whom I have chosen, / In order that you may know and believe Me / And understand that I am He. / Before Me there was no God formed, / Neither will there be any after Me.
I, even I, am Jehovah; / And there is no Savior besides Me.
I have declared, and I have saved, and I have let them hear; / There is no strange god among you. / And you are My witnesses, declares Jehovah, / And I am God.
Indeed, before the day was, I am He, / And there is no one who can deliver from My hand. / I will work and who will reverse it?
Thus says Jehovah, / Your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, / For your sake I have sent to Babylon, / And I will bring down all of them as fugitives, / Even the Chaldeans, whose rejoicing is in the ships.
I am Jehovah, your Holy One, / The Creator of Israel, your King.
Thus says Jehovah, / Who has made a way in the sea, / And a path in the mighty waters,
Who brings forth the chariot and the horse, / The army and the powerful together. / They will lie down, they will not rise; / They are extinct, they are quenched like flax.
Do not call to mind the former things, / Nor consider the things of old.
Indeed, I am doing a new thing; / It will now spring forth; / Do you not know it? / I will even make a way in the wilderness, / Rivers in the desert.
The animals of the field will honor Me, / The jackals and the ostriches, / Because I have given them water in the wilderness, / Rivers in the desert, / To give a drink to My people, My chosen ones.
This people I have formed for Myself; / They will show forth My praise.
But you have not called upon Me, O Jacob, / But you have grown weary of Me, O Israel.
You have not brought Me a sheep for your burnt offerings, / And you have not honored Me with your sacrifices; / I have not made you serve Me with a meal offering, / Nor wearied you with incense.
You did not buy calamus for Me with money, / And you did not fill Me with the fat of your sacrifices. / Indeed, you have burdened Me with your sins; / You have wearied Me with your iniquities.
I, even I, am He who wipes away your transgressions for My own sake, / And I will not remember your sins.
Put Me in remembrance; let us plead in judgment together: / Declare your case that you may be justified.
Your first father sinned, / And your mediators transgressed against Me.
Therefore I profaned the princes of the sanctuary, / And I delivered up Jacob to destruction, / And Israel to reviling.
