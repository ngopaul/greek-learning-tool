Come down and sit in the dust, / O virgin daughter of Babylon; / Sit on the ground where there is no throne, / O daughter of the Chaldeans; / For you will no longer be called / Tender and delicate.
Take millstones and grind meal; / Remove your veil; / Strip off your flowing skirt; uncover your thigh; / Cross over the rivers.
Your nakedness will be uncovered; / Your shame will also be seen; / I will take vengeance and will not spare any man.
Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is His name, / The Holy One of Israel!
Sit in silence and go in darkness, / O daughter of the Chaldeans; / For you will no longer be called / The queen of kingdoms.
I was angry with My people; / I profaned My inheritance, / And I have delivered them up into your hand. / You have not shown any mercy to them; / You have made your yoke / Very heavy upon the elderly.
You have said, I will be / A queen forever; / You did not put these things into your heart; / You did not remember the end of them.
And now hear this, O lover of pleasure, / Who dwells securely / And says in your heart, / I am, and there is none besides me; / I will not dwell as a widow, / And I will not know loss of children.
But these two things will come upon you / Suddenly, in one day: / Loss of children and widowhood; / In full measure they will come upon you / In spite of the multitude of your sorceries; / In spite of the great power of your spells.
And you felt secure in your wickedness; / You said, No one sees me. / Your wisdom and your knowledge / Have seduced you, / And you said in your heart, / I am, and there is none besides me.
But evil will come upon you, / And you will not know its origin; / Disaster will fall upon you / Which you cannot expiate for; / Desolation will come upon you suddenly, / About which you do not know.
Stand now with your enchantments / And the multitude of your sorceries, / With which you have labored from your youth; / Perhaps you can profit; / Perhaps you will inspire terror.
You are wearied with the multitude of your counsels. / Let the astrologers, who gaze at the stars, / Who predict according to the new moons, / Stand up and save you from what is coming upon you.
Indeed, they are like stubble; / Fire consumes them; / They cannot deliver themselves / From the power of the flame; / There is no coal for warming themselves, / Nor the light of a fire to sit before.
So will those with whom you have labored be to you, / Those who have traded with you from your youth; / Each one will wander off in his own direction; / There will be no one to save you.
