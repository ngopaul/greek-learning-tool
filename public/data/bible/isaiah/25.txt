O Jehovah, You are my God; / I will exalt You, I will give thanks to Your name, / For You have done wonderful things--/ Counsels of old, in faithfulness, perfect faithfulness.
For You have made of a city a heap, / Of a fortified town a ruin. / A palace of strangers becomes no city at all; / It will never be rebuilt.
Therefore a strong people will glorify You; / The cities of terrifying nations will fear You.
For You have been a stronghold to the weak, / A stronghold to the needy in his distress, / A refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat; / For the breath of those who terrify is like a tempest against a wall.
Like the heat in a drought, / You will subdue the uproar of strangers; / Like the heat through the shadow of a cloud, / The song of those who terrify will be brought low.
And Jehovah of hosts will make on this mountain / For all the peoples / A feast of fat things, / A feast of wine matured on the lees, / Of fat things full of marrow, / And of filtered wine matured on the lees.
And on this mountain He will swallow up / The covering that covers up all the peoples, / Even the veil that veils all the nations.
He will swallow up death forever; / And the Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces; / And the reproach of His people He will remove from all the earth; / For Jehovah has spoken.
And it will be said in that day, / Here, this is our God, / For whom we have waited that He may save us. / This is Jehovah, for whom we have waited; / Let us be glad and rejoice in His salvation.
For the hand of Jehovah will rest on this mountain, / And Moab will be threshed in his place, / Even as straw is threshed in the water of a dung heap.
And he will spread out his hands in the middle of it, / As a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim; / But Jehovah will abase his pride together with the trickery of his hands.
And the lofty fortification of your walls He will bring down, / Lay low, and cast to the ground, even to the dust.
