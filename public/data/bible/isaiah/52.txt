Awake! Awake! Put on / Your strength, O Zion; / Put on your beautiful garments, / O Jerusalem, O holy city; / For the uncircumcised and the unclean / Will no longer come into you.
Shake yourself from the dust; arise, / Sit down, O Jerusalem; / Loose yourself from the bonds on your neck, / O captive daughter of Zion.
For thus says Jehovah, You are those who have been sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without money.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah, At first My people went down to Egypt to sojourn there; then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
Now then what do I have here, declares Jehovah, since My people have been taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them howl, declares Jehovah, and My name is continually blasphemed all day long.
Therefore My people will know My name; therefore in that day they will know that I am He who speaks; here I am.
How beautiful on the mountains / Are the feet of him who brings good news, / Of him who announces peace, who brings news of good things, / Who announces salvation; / Of him who says to Zion, Your God reigns!
The voice of your watchmen! They lift up their voice; / They give a ringing shout together; / For they will see with their very own eyes / When Jehovah restores Zion.
Break forth, give a ringing shout together, / You wasted places of Jerusalem, / For Jehovah has comforted His people, / He has redeemed Jerusalem.
Jehovah has bared His holy arm / In the sight of all the nations, / And all the ends of the earth will see / The salvation of our God.
Depart! Depart! Go out from there! / Do not touch any unclean thing! / Go out from the midst of her! Cleanse yourselves, / You who bear the vessels of Jehovah!
For you will not go out in haste, / And you will not go in flight; / For Jehovah will go before you, / And the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
Indeed, My Servant will act wisely and will prosper; / He will be exalted and lifted up and very high.
Even as many were astonished at Him--/ His visage was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men--
So will He surprise many nations; / Kings will shut their mouths because of Him; / For what had not been recounted to them they will see, / And what they had not heard of they will contemplate.
