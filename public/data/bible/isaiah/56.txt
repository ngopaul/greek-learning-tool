Thus says Jehovah, / Preserve justice and do righteousness, / For My salvation is about to come / And My righteousness is about to be revealed.
Blessed is the man who does this, / And the son of man who takes hold of it, / Who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane it / And keeps his hand from doing any evil.
And let not the son of a foreigner / Who has joined himself to Jehovah speak, saying, / Jehovah will surely separate me from His people; / Nor let the eunuch say, / Now I am a dry tree.
For thus says Jehovah, / To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths / And choose what pleases Me, / And hold fast My covenant,
To them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial and a name / Better than that of sons and daughters; / I will give them an eternal name / Which will not be cut off.
Also the children of the foreigner who join themselves to Jehovah, / To minister to Him and to love the name of Jehovah, / To be servants to Him, / Everyone who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane it / And holds fast My covenant,
Even these will I cause to come to My holy mountain / And to rejoice in My house of prayer; / Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable upon My altar; / For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.
The Lord Jehovah, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares: / Yet will I gather others to Him besides those gathered to Him already.
All you animals of the field, come to eat, / All you animals of the forest.
His watchmen are blind; / All of them know nothing; / All of them are dumb dogs, / They cannot bark; / Dreamers who lie down / And love to slumber.
And these dogs are greedy; / They know no satisfaction. / And they are shepherds / Who lack understanding. / All of them have turned to their own way, / Each to his own gain, to the last of them.
Come, they say, let me get some wine, / And let us drink down some liquor; / And tomorrow will be like today, / Only much more abundant.
