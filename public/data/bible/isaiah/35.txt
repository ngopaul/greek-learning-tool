The wilderness and the desert will be glad; / And the desert will exult and blossom / Like the rose.
It will blossom and blossom, / And even exult with exultation and a ringing shout. / The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, / The splendor of Carmel and Sharon; / They will see the glory of Jehovah, / The splendor of our God.
Strengthen the weak hands, / And confirm the shaking knees.
Say to those who are of anxious heart, / Be strong; fear not; / Indeed your God / Will come with vengeance, / With the recompense of God; / He will come and save you.
Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, / And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped;
Then the lame will leap like a hart, / And the tongue of the dumb will give a ringing shout; / For water will break forth in the wilderness, / And streams in the desert.
And the desert mirage will become a pool, / And the thirsty ground, springs of water; / In the habitation of jackals, their resting place, / There will be grass with reeds and rushes.
And a highway will be there, and a way, / And it will be called, The Way of Holiness. / The unclean will not pass on it, / But it will be for him who walks on the way; / No fools will err in it.
There will be no lion there, / Nor will any ravenous animal go up on it; / They will not be found there; / But the redeemed will walk on it.
And the ransomed of Jehovah will return / And will come to Zion with a ringing shout, / And eternal joy will be upon their heads. / They will lay hold on gladness and joy, / And sorrow and sighing will flee away.
