The burden concerning Moab: Indeed in a night it is devastated--/ Ar of Moab is cut off. / Indeed in a night it is devastated--/ Kir of Moab is cut off.
They have gone up to their temple and to Dibon, / That is, to their high places, to weep. / Over Nebo and over Medeba / Moab howls; / Upon all their heads is baldness; / Every beard is shaved off.
In their streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth; / On their roofs / And in their open squares everyone will howl, / Melting in tears.
And Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; / Their voice is heard as far as Jahaz. / Because of this the armed men of Moab raise a cry; / Their soul quivers within them.
My heart cries out for Moab; / Its fugitives reach as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath-shelishiyah: / By the ascent of Luhith / With weeping they will go up; / On the way that leads to Horonaim / They will raise up a cry of destruction;
The waters of Nimrim / Will be a devastation; / The foliage will be dried up, the grass wasted away; / There will be nothing green.
As a result, the abundance they have produced / And placed in reserve / Will be carried off / To the poplar brook.
For the cry has gone about / The border of Moab; / Their howling goes as far as Eglaim, / Even to Beer-elim their howling reaches.
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood, / For I will bring upon Dimon additional things: / Lions upon those in Moab who escape / And upon the remnant of the land.
