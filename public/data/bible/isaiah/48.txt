Hear this, O house of Jacob, / Who are called by the name of Israel; / And who came out from the waters of Judah, / Who swear by the name of Jehovah / And make mention of the God of Israel, / But not in truth nor in righteousness.
For they call themselves after the holy city / And lean upon the God of Israel; / Jehovah of hosts is His name.
I have declared the former things from the beginning; / And they went out from My mouth, and I let them hear them; / I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.
Because I knew that you are obstinate, / And your neck is an iron sinew, / And your forehead bronze;
Therefore I declared them to you long ago; / Before things came to pass I let you hear; / Lest you should say, My idol has done them, / And my graven image and my molten image commanded them.
You have heard; look at all this. And will you not declare it? / From this time I will let you hear new things / And hidden things which you have not known.
They have been created now, and not long ago; / And before this day you have not even heard them; / Lest you should say, Indeed, I knew them.
You also have not heard and have not known; / Your ears were not even open from that time; / For I knew that you would deal very treacherously / And would be called a transgressor from the womb.
For My name's sake I will defer My anger, / And for the sake of My praise I will restrain it for you, / In order not to cut you off.
Indeed, I have refined you but not like silver; / I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.
For My own sake, yes, for My own sake, I will do it, / For how can My name be profaned? / And I will not give My glory to another.
Listen to Me, O Jacob, / And Israel, whom I called; / I am He; I am the First, / I am also the Last.
Indeed, My hand laid the foundations of the earth, / And My right hand spread out the heavens; / When I call to them, / They stand together.
Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear! / Who among them has declared these things? / Jehovah loves him; he will do His pleasure / On Babylon, and His arm will be upon the Chaldeans.
I, even I, have spoken; indeed, I have called him; / I have brought him, and his way will prosper.
Draw near to Me and listen to this: / From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; / From the time it took place, I was there. / And now the Lord Jehovah / Has sent me and His Spirit.
Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, / The Holy One of Israel, / I am Jehovah your God, / Who teaches you to do that which is profitable, / Who leads you in the way that you should go.
If only you had hearkened to My commandments! / Then your peace would have been like a river, / And your righteousness like the waves of the sea,
And your seed would have been like the sand, / And the offspring of your bowels like the gravel; / His name would not have been cut off / Or destroyed before Me.
Come out from Babylon; / Flee from the Chaldeans; / With a voice of shouting declare; / Let them hear this, / Send it out unto the end of the earth; / Say, Jehovah has redeemed / His servant Jacob.
And they did not thirst / When He led them through the dry places; / He caused water to flow / From the rock for them; / And He split the rock, / And the waters gushed out.
There is no peace, says Jehovah, for the wicked.
