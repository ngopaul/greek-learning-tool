Thus says Jehovah, / Where is the bill of your mother's divorce / With which I have put her away? / Or to which of My creditors / Have I sold you? / Indeed, for your iniquities you were sold, / And for your transgressions your mother was put away.
Why when I came was there no man? / And when I called why was there no one to answer? / Is My hand so short that it cannot redeem? / Or do I have no power to deliver? / Indeed, at My rebuke I dry up the sea; / I make the rivers a wilderness; / Their fish stink because there is no water, / And die of thirst.
I clothe the heavens with blackness, / And make sackcloth their covering.
The Lord Jehovah has given me / The tongue of the instructed, / That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word. / He awakens me morning by morning; / He awakens my ear / To hear as an instructed one.
The Lord Jehovah has opened my ear; / And I was not rebellious, / Nor did I turn back.
I gave my back to those who strike me / And my cheeks to those who pluck out the hair; / I did not hide my face / From humiliation and spitting.
The Lord Jehovah helps me; / Therefore I have not been dishonored; / Therefore I have set my face like a flint, / And I know that I will not be put to shame.
The One who justifies me is near; who will contend with me? / Let us stand up together! / Who is my adversary in judgment? / Let him come near to me.
Indeed, the Lord Jehovah helps me: / Who is the one who condemns me? / Indeed, they will all wear out like a garment; / The moth will consume them.
Who among you fears Jehovah; / Who hears the voice of His servant; / Who walks in darkness / And has no light? / Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, / And rely on his God.
Indeed, all of you who kindle a fire, / Who surround yourselves with firebrands, / Walk into the light of your fire / And into the firebrands which you have lit. / You will have this from My hand: / You will lie down in torment.
