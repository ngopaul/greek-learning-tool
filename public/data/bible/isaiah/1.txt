The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah:
Hear, O heavens, and hearken, O earth, / For Jehovah has spoken: / I have brought up children, and I have raised them; / And yet they have rebelled against Me.
The ox knows his owner, / And the donkey, his master's manger; / But Israel does not know, / My people do not much consider.
Alas, sinful nation, / A people heavy with iniquity, / Seed of evildoers, / Children acting corruptly! / They have forsaken Jehovah; / They have despised the Holy One of Israel; / They have become estranged and have gone backward.
Where will you be stricken again? / Will you continue your apostasy? / The whole head has become sick, / And the whole heart faint;
From the sole of the foot even to the head, / There is no soundness in it, / Only bruises and blows / And raw wounds--/ They have not been pressed out nor bound up / Nor softened with oil.
Your land is a desolation; / Your cities are burned with fire; / Your field--in your sight / Strangers devour it; / It is a desolation, like something overthrown by strangers.
And the daughter of Zion is left / Like a booth in a vineyard, / Like a hut in a cucumber field, / Like a besieged city.
Unless Jehovah of hosts / Had left to us a surviving few, / We would have been like Sodom, / We would have resembled Gomorrah.
Hear the word of Jehovah, / You rulers of Sodom; / Hearken to the instruction of our God, / You people of Gomorrah.
What is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? / Says Jehovah. / I have had My fill of burnt offerings of rams / And the fat of fed cattle; / The blood of bulls and lambs / And goats, I do not delight in.
When you come to appear before Me, / Who has required this of your hand, / To trample My courts?
Bring no more vain offerings; / Incense is an abomination to Me. / New moon and Sabbath, the calling of convocations--/ I cannot bear iniquity and the solemn assembly.
Your new moons and your appointed feasts / My soul hates; / They have become a burden on Me; / I am weary of bearing them.
Thus, when you spread forth your hands, / I will hide My eyes from you; / Even though you multiply your prayers, / I will not hear. / Your hands are full of blood;
Wash yourselves; cleanse yourselves. / Turn away the evil of your deeds / From before My eyes. / Cease doing what is evil;
Learn to do good. / Seek justice; / Correct the ruthless. / Defend the orphan; / Plead for the widow.
Come now and let us reason together, / Says Jehovah. / Though your sins are like scarlet, / They will be as white as snow; / Though they are as red as crimson, / They will be like wool.
If you are willing and listen, / You will eat the good of the land;
But if you refuse and rebel, / You will be devoured by the sword; / For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.
How the faithful city / Has become a harlot! / She who was full of justice, / She in whom righteousness once lodged, / But now murderers!
Your silver has become dross; / Your wine diluted with water;
Your rulers are rebellious / And companions of thieves; / They all love bribes / And chase after rewards; / They do not defend the orphan, / Nor does the widow's plea come before them.
Hence, the Lord Jehovah of hosts, / The Mighty One of Israel, declares: / Ah, I will ease Myself of My adversaries, / And I will avenge Myself of My enemies;
And I will turn My hand against you. / I will thoroughly purge away your dross as with lye, / And I will remove all your alloy.
And I will restore your judges as at the first / And your counselors as at the beginning. / Afterward you will be called the city of righteousness, / The faithful city.
Zion will be ransomed with justice, / And her returning ones with righteousness.
And there will be the shattering of rebels and sinners together, / And those who forsake Jehovah will meet their end.
For you will be ashamed of the terebinths / That you have taken pleasure in; / And you will be embarrassed at the gardens / That you have chosen.
For you will be like a terebinth / Whose leaves are falling, / And like a garden / In which there is no water;
And the strong man will become tow, / And his work a spark; / And they will both burn together, / And there will be none to extinguish them.
