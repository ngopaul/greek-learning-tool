Draw near, O nations, to hear; / And listen, O peoples! / Let the earth and all that fills it hear, / The world and all that springs forth from it.
For Jehovah's indignation is upon all the nations, / And His wrath is upon all their armies; / He has utterly destroyed them; / He has delivered them unto the slaughter.
Thus their slain are cast away, / And from their corpses their stench will come up; / And the mountains will be melted with their blood.
And all the armies of heaven will be dissolved, / And the heavens will be rolled up like a scroll, / And all their host will wither away, / As the leaf withers from the vine, / Or like a leaf withering from the fig tree.
For My sword has drunk its fill in heaven. / Now it will descend in judgment upon Edom / And upon the people whom I have devoted to judgment.
Jehovah's sword is full of blood; / It has fattened itself with fat, / With the blood of lambs and goats, / With the fat of the kidneys of rams; / For Jehovah has a sacrifice in Bozrah / And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
Wild oxen will also go down with them, / The young bulls with the bulls; / And their land will drink its fill of their blood, / And their dust will become fat with their fat.
For Jehovah has a day of vengeance, / A year of recompense for Zion's contention.
And its streams will be turned into pitch, / And its dust into brimstone; / And its land will become burning pitch.
It will not be quenched by night or by day; / Its smoke will go up forever; / It will be desolate from generation to generation; / No one will pass through it forever and ever.
But the pelican and the porcupine will inherit it, / And the owl and the raven will dwell in it; / And He will stretch over it / The line of nothingness and the plummet weights of emptiness.
As for its nobles, there is no one there whom they may call to assume the kingdom, / And all its princes will be nothing.
And thorns will come up in its citadels, / Nettles and thistles in its fortified cities; / And it will be a habitation for jackals, / And an abode for ostriches.
Desert animals will meet with hyenas; / And the demon will call to his kind, / Indeed there Lilith will settle / And find a resting place for herself.
There the owl will make its nest and lay eggs, / And hatch them and gather them under its protection; / Indeed there the vultures will be gathered together, / Each with its kind.
Seek from the book of Jehovah and read. / Not one of these will be missing; / Not one will lack her mate; / For His mouth has commanded it, / And it is His Spirit who has gathered them.
And He has cast the lot for them, / And His hand has divided it by line unto them; / They will inherit it forever; / From generation to generation they will dwell in it.
