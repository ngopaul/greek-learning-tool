Bel has bowed down; Nebo stoops; / Their idols are on beasts and cattle; / The things which you carry are a burden, / A load for a weary beast.
They stoop and have bowed down together; / They are not able to escape the burden; / But they themselves have gone into captivity.
Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, / And all the remnant of the house of Israel, / You who have been borne from birth, / Who have been carried from the womb,
Even unto old age, I am He; / Even unto your gray-haired years, I will bear you. / I have made and I will carry, / And I will bear and deliver.
To whom will you liken Me, / And with whom will you make Me equal / And compare Me, that we should be considered alike?
Those who lavish gold from the purse / And weigh silver in scales / And hire a goldsmith, and he makes a god--/ They bow down and even worship it;
They lift it up on their shoulder; they carry it / And set it in its place, and it stands. / It will not move from its place; / Someone even cries out to it, and it does not answer, / Nor save him from his distress.
Remember this and stand fast; / Put this in your heart, O transgressors.
Remember the former things of old, / That I am God and there is no one else; / I am God and there is no one like Me,
Who declares the end from the beginning / And things which have not been done from ancient times, / Saying, My counsel will stand, / And all My desire I will accomplish;
Who calls for a bird of prey from the east, / And from a distant land a man to be My counselor. / Indeed, I have spoken; surely I will bring it to pass. / I have purposed; surely I will do it.
Listen to Me, O hardhearted ones, / Who are far from righteousness.
I will bring My righteousness near--it is not far off; / And My salvation will not delay; / And I will give salvation in Zion, / And to Israel My glory.
