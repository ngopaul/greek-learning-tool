Jehovah now makes the earth desolate and lays it waste; He distorts its surface and scatters its inhabitants:
As it is with the people, so will it be with the priest; / As it is with the servant, so will it be with the master; / As it is with the maid, so will it be with the mistress; / As it is with the buyer, so will it be with the seller; / As it is with the lender, so will it be with the borrower; / As it is with the creditor, so will it be with him to whom he gives credit.
The earth will be utterly desolated / And utterly spoiled, / For Jehovah has spoken this word.
The earth dries up and fades away; / The world languishes and fades away; / The exalted of the people of the earth languish.
And the earth is polluted under the weight of its inhabitants; / For they have transgressed laws, they have violated statutes, / They have broken an eternal covenant.
Therefore a curse devours the earth / And the inhabitants of it are held guilty; / Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, / And few men are left.
The new wine mourns; the vine languishes; / All the merryhearted sigh.
The mirth of the tambourines ceases; / The noise of those who exult stops; / The mirth of the lyre ceases.
Men do not drink wine in song; / Liquor is bitter to those who drink it.
The city of chaos is broken down; / Every house is shut up that none may enter.
A cry for wine is in the streets; / All joy is darkened; / The mirth of the land is departed.
In the city desolation remains, / And the gate is crushed to ruins.
For thus will it be in the midst of the earth, / Among the peoples: / Like the shaking of an olive tree, / Like the gleanings when the grape harvest is completed.
They will lift up their voice; they will give a ringing shout; / Because of the majesty of Jehovah they will cry out from the west.
Therefore in the east glorify Jehovah, / Even the name of Jehovah the God of Israel in the coastlands of the sea.
From the ends of the earth we hear songs: / Glory to the righteous One! / But I say, Leanness to me! Leanness to me! Woe to me! / The unfaithful deal unfaithfully! / Indeed the unfaithful deal most unfaithfully!
Dread, pit, and snare / Are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.
And he who flees from the sound of dread / Will fall into the pit, / And he who comes up out of the pit / Will be taken in the snare; / For the windows from on high are open, / And the foundations of the earth shake.
The earth is broken asunder; / The earth is split through and through; / The earth is shaken violently.
The earth staggers back and forth like a drunkard / And sways about like a field hut. / And its transgression weighs heavily upon it; / It will fall and will not rise again.
And in that day Jehovah will punish / On high the host on high, / And the kings of the earth on the earth.
And they will be gathered together, / Like prisoners gathered in a dungeon; / And they will be shut up in prison, / And after many days they will be punished.
Then the moon will be abashed, and the sun will be ashamed; / For Jehovah of hosts will reign / In Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, / And His glory will be before His elders.
