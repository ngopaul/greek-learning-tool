Who is this who comes from Edom / With red-stained garments, from Bozrah? / This One who is majestic in His apparel, / Marching in the greatness of His strength? / It is I who speak in righteousness, / Mighty to save.
Why are You red in apparel, / And Your garments like those of him who treads in the winepress?
I have trodden the wine trough alone, / And from the peoples there was no man with Me. / And I trod them in My anger / And trampled them in My wrath; / And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, / And I have stained all My apparel.
For the day of recompense was in My heart, / And the year of My redemption had come.
And I looked and there was no one to help; / And I was appalled that there was no one to uphold. / Therefore My own arm accomplished salvation for Me, / And My wrath, it upheld Me.
And I trod down the peoples in My anger / And made them drunk in My wrath, / And I poured out their lifeblood upon the earth.
I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah, / The praises of Jehovah, / According to all that Jehovah has bestowed on us / And the great goodness toward the house of Israel, / Which He has bestowed on them according to His compassions / And according to the multitude of His lovingkindnesses.
For He said, Surely, they are My people, / Children who will not deal falsely; / So He became their Savior.
In all their affliction He was afflicted, / And the Angel of His presence saved them; / In His love and in His mercy / He redeemed them, / And He bore them up and carried them / All the days of old.
But they rebelled and grieved / His Spirit of holiness; / Therefore He turned to become their enemy; / He fought against them.
Then He remembered the days of old, Moses and His people: / Where is He who brought them up out of the sea / With the shepherds of His flock? / Where is He who put in their midst / His Spirit of holiness;
Who made His glorious arm / Go at the right hand of Moses; / Who divided the waters before them, / To make for Himself a name forever;
Who led them through the depths, / Like a horse in the wilderness, / And they did not stumble?
Like the cattle which go down into the valley, / The Spirit of Jehovah caused them to rest. / Thus did You lead Your people, / To make for Yourself a glorious name.
Look down from heaven, / And see from the habitation of Your holiness and Your beauty: / Where are Your zeal and Your mighty acts? / The stirring of Your inward parts / And Your compassions are restrained toward me.
For You are our Father, / Since Abraham does not know us, / And Israel does not acknowledge us. / You, Jehovah, are our Father; / Our Redeemer from eternity is Your name.
Why, O Jehovah, do You cause us to wander from Your ways / And harden our hearts so that we do not fear You? / Return for the sake of Your servants, / The tribes of Your inheritance.
Your holy people have possessed Your sanctuary for a little while; / Our adversaries have trodden it down.
We have become like those over whom You have never ruled, / Like those who have not been called by Your name.
