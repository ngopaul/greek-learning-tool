Then a sprout will come forth from the stump of Jesse, / And a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
And the Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him, / The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, / The Spirit of counsel and might, / The Spirit of the knowledge and fear of Jehovah.
He will delight in the fear of Jehovah: / He will neither judge by what His eyes see, / Nor decide by what His ears hear.
But He will judge the poor in righteousness, / And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land. / And He will strike the land with the rod of His mouth, / And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked.
Righteousness will be that which girds His loins, / And faithfulness will be that which girds His hips.
And the wolf will dwell with the lamb; / And the leopard will lie down with the kid, / And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; / And a young boy will lead them about.
The cow and the bear will graze; / Their young will lie down together; / And the lion will eat straw like the ox.
The nursing child will play by the cobra's hole, / And upon the viper's den / The weaned child will stretch his hand.
They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, / For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah, / As water covers the sea.
And in that day the root of Jesse, / Who stands as a banner to the peoples--/ Him will the nations seek, / And His resting place will be the glory.
And in that day the Lord, / By His hand for the second time again, / Will recover the remnant of His people / Who remain, from Assyria and from Egypt, / From Pathros, Cush, and Elam, / From Shinar, Hamath, and the islands of the sea.
He will lift up a standard to the nations, / And will gather the outcasts of Israel; / And the dispersed of Judah He will assemble / From the four corners of the earth.
And Ephraim's jealousy will depart, / And the adversaries in Judah will be cut off; / Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, / Nor will Judah be hostile to Ephraim.
And they will fly down upon the shoulders of the Philistines on the west; / Together they will plunder the children of the east. / Edom and Moab will come into the grasp of their hand, / And the children of Ammon will submit to them.
And Jehovah will utterly destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt; / And He will wave His hand over the River with the scorching of His wind, / And He will strike it into seven streams, / And march men through it dryshod.
And there will be a highway from Assyria / For the remnant of His people which remain, / As there was for Israel / In the day that they came up from the land of Egypt.
