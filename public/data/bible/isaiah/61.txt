The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me, / Because Jehovah has anointed Me / To bring good news to the afflicted; / He has sent Me to bind up the wounds of the brokenhearted, / To proclaim liberty to the captives, / And the opening of the eyes to those who are bound;
To proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah / And the day of vengeance of our God; / To comfort all who mourn;
To grant to those who mourn in Zion, / To give to them a headdress instead of ashes, / The oil of gladness instead of mourning, / The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness; / That they may be called the terebinths of righteousness, / The planting of Jehovah, that He may be glorified.
And they will rebuild the ancient ruins; / They will raise up the former desolations; / And they will repair the cities of waste, / The desolations of generation upon generation.
And strangers will stand and feed your flocks, / And the sons of the foreigner will be your plowmen and vinedressers.
But you will be called the priests of Jehovah; / People will speak of you as the ministers of our God. / You will eat the wealth of nations, / And you will boast in their glory.
Instead of your shame there will be a double portion, / And instead of humiliation they will give a ringing shout for their portion. / Therefore in their land they will possess double; / Eternal joy will be theirs.
For I, Jehovah, love justice; / I hate robbery with wrong; / And I will faithfully give them their recompense, / And I will make an eternal covenant with them.
Then their seed will be known among the nations, / And their offspring in the midst of the peoples; / All who see them will acknowledge them, / That they are the seed whom Jehovah has blessed.
I will rejoice greatly in Jehovah, / My soul will exult in my God; / For He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, / He has wrapped me with the robe of righteousness; / I am like a bridegroom who wears the headdress of the priest, / And like a bride who adorns herself with her jewels.
For as the earth brings forth its sprout, / And as the garden causes the things sown in it to spring up, / So will the Lord Jehovah cause righteousness and praise / To spring up before all the nations.
