Indeed a King will reign according to righteousness, / And the rulers will rule according to justice.
And a man will be like a refuge from the wind / And a covering from the tempest, / Like streams of water in a dry place, / Like the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land.
And the eyes of those who see will not be dim, / And the ears of those who hear will attend.
And the heart of the hasty will understand knowledge, / And the tongue of those who stammer will hasten to speak elegantly.
The fool will no longer be called noble, / Nor will the cheat be said to be generous;
For the fool will speak foolishness, / And his heart will commit iniquity / By committing profaneness / And by speaking error against Jehovah, / By leaving the soul of the hungry empty / And by causing drink for the thirsty to fail.
And as for the cheat, his tools are evil; / He devises wicked schemes / To destroy the poor with false words / Even when the needy speaks rightly.
But the noble man devises noble things, / And upon noble things he stands.
Rise up, O women who are at ease, / And hear my voice; / O daughters of complacency, / Hearken to my words.
In a year and some days / You will be troubled, O complacent ones; / For the vintage is at its end; / The ingathering will not come.
Tremble, O women at ease; / Be troubled, O complacent ones. / Strip yourselves and be bare, / And gird your loins with sackcloth.
They beat their breasts / For the pleasant fields, / For the fruitful vine.
Upon the land of my people / Will come up thorns and briers, / Indeed upon all the jubilant houses / In the exultant city.
Because the palace will be abandoned; / The multitude of the city will be forsaken; / The Hill and the watchtower / Will become caves forever, / A joy for wild asses, / A pasture for flocks;
Until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, / And the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, / And the fruitful field is considered to be a forest.
Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, / And righteousness will remain in the fruitful field;
And the work of righteousness will be peace, / And the result of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever.
And my people will live in a peaceful habitation / And in secure dwellings and carefree resting places.
And it will hail when the forest comes down, / And the city will be utterly laid low.
Blessed are you who sow beside all the water, / Who send there the feet of the ox and the donkey.
