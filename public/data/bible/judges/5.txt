Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying:
That the leaders took the lead in Israel, / That the people have willingly offered themselves, / Bless Jehovah.
Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes! / I will sing; I, to Jehovah. / I will sing praise to Jehovah / The God of Israel.
O Jehovah, when You went forth from Seir, / When You marched from the field of Edom, / The earth trembled, the heavens also dripped, / Indeed the clouds dripped water.
The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah, / Sinai there, at the presence of Jehovah the God of Israel.
In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, / In the days of Jael, the highways were not used; / And travelers went / On the roundabout paths.
The villages ceased to act; / They ceased in Israel; / Until I, Deborah, rose up; / Until I rose up as a mother in Israel.
They chose new gods; / Then there was war in their gates. / Was a shield or a spear seen / Among forty thousand in Israel?
My heart is with the commanders of Israel, / Those who offered themselves willingly among the people. / Bless Jehovah!
Tell of it, you who ride on white donkeys, / You who sit on rich carpets, / And you who go upon the way.
Louder than the voice of those who distribute water among the watering places, / There they recount the righteous deeds of Jehovah, / His righteous acts toward His villages in Israel. / Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.
Awake! Awake, Deborah! / Awake! Awake, speak forth a song! / Arise, Barak; / And lead captive your captives, son of Abinoam.
Then a remnant of the nobles went down; / The people of Jehovah went down with me against the mighty:
From Ephraim, those who took root in Amalek; / Following you, Benjamin, with your peoples; / From Machir commanders came down, / And from Zebulun those who wielded the staff of him who marshals.
And the princes in Issachar were with Deborah; / And Issachar was true to Barak; / Into the valley they were sent behind him. / Among the divisions of Reuben / There were great resolutions in heart.
Why did you sit among the sheepfolds / Listening to the pipings for the flocks? / In the divisions of Reuben / There were great searchings of heart.
Gilead stayed across the Jordan. / And as for Dan, why did he remain with the ships? / Asher sat at the shore of the sea / And stayed at his landings.
Zebulun was a people that despised their own lives even unto death; / And Naphtali, on the heights of the field.
The kings came; they fought. / At that time the kings of Canaan fought / In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; / They took no gain of silver.
From heaven the stars fought; / From their courses they fought with Sisera.
The river Kishon swept them away, / The ancient river, the river Kishon. / March on, O my soul, with strength!
At that time the horse hooves stamped / With the prancing, the prancing of their mighty steeds.
Curse Meroz, says the Angel of Jehovah; / Bitterly curse its inhabitants. / For they did not come to the aid of Jehovah, / To the aid of Jehovah against the mighty.
Blessed among women shall Jael be, / The wife of Heber the Kenite; / Blessed among the women in the tent shall she be.
He asked for water; she gave him milk. / In a bowl for nobles she presented him with cream.
She put her hand to the tent peg, / And her right hand to the workman's hammer; / Then she struck Sisera; she smashed his head; / Indeed she shattered and pierced his temples.
At her feet he bowed; he fell; he lay down. / At her feet he bowed; he fell. / Where he bowed, there he fell, destroyed.
Through the window one looks forth and cries shrilly; / The mother of Sisera, through the lattice: / Why is his chariot so long in coming? / Why do the tracks of his chariots delay?
The wisest of her ladies answer her, / And she herself returns an answer to herself:
Have they not found and divided the spoil? / A girl, two girls, to each mighty man. / The spoil of dyed garments to Sisera, / The spoil of dyed garments; / A dyed embroidery, two embroideries, / For the neck of the spoiler.
May all Your enemies so perish, O Jehovah. / But may those who love Him be like the sun / When it rises in its might. And the land had rest forty years.
