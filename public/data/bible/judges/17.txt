Now there was a man from the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.
And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse and spoke it in my hearing--look, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed of Jehovah be my son!
And he returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I do consecrate the silver to Jehovah from my hand to my son to make a sculptured idol and a molten image. Now therefore I will return it to you.
And when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the founder, who made them into a sculptured idol and a molten image. And it was in the house of Micah.
And the man Micah had a house of gods; and he made an ephod and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons to become his priest.
In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.
And there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was a sojourner there.
And the man left the city Bethlehem in Judah to dwell wherever he could find a place. And he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he made his way.
And Micah said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am traveling in order to dwell wherever I can find a place.
And Micah said to him, Stay with me, and be a father and a priest to me; and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and an array of clothing and your food. So the Levite went with him.
And the Levite was content to stay with the man; and the young man was to him like one of his sons.
And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest and was in the house of Micah.
Then Micah said, Now I know that Jehovah will prosper me, because the Levite has become my priest.
