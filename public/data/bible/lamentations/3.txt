I am the man who has seen affliction / By the rod of His wrath.
He has driven me and brought me / Into darkness and not light.
Surely against me He has turned His hand / Again and again all the day.
He has wasted my flesh and my skin; / He has broken my bones.
He has built up a siege against me / And encircled me with gall and travail.
He has made me dwell in dark places, / Like those who have long been dead.
He has walled me about so that I cannot go forth; / He has made my bronze chain heavy.
Indeed, when I cry out and call for help, / He shuts out my prayer.
He has walled in my ways with hewn stone; / He has made my paths crooked.
He is to me like a bear lying in wait, / Like a lion in hidden places.
He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces; / He has made me desolate.
He bent His bow / And set me as a target for the arrow.
He has caused the arrows of His quiver / To enter my inward parts.
I have become a derision to all my people, / Their mocking song all the day.
He has filled me with bitterness; / He has made me drunk with wormwood.
He has also crushed my teeth with gravel; / He has covered me with ashes.
And You have removed my soul far from peace; / I have forgotten prosperity.
And I said, My strength has perished / As well as my hope in Jehovah.
Remember my affliction and my wandering, / The wormwood and the gall.
My soul remembers them well / And is bowed down within me.
This I recall to my heart; / Therefore I have hope.
It is Jehovah's lovingkindness that we are not consumed, / For His compassions do not fail;
They are new every morning; / Great is Your faithfulness.
Jehovah is my portion, says my soul; / Therefore I hope in Him.
Jehovah is good to those who wait on Him, / To the soul that seeks Him.
It is good for one to hope, and to do so in silence, / For the salvation of Jehovah.
It is good for a man to bear / The yoke in his youth.
Let him sit alone and be silent, / Because He has laid it upon him.
Let him put his mouth in the dust--/ Perhaps there is hope.
Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him; / Let him be filled with reproach.
For the Lord will not / Cast off forever.
But even if He causes grief, He will have compassion / According to the multitude of His lovingkindness;
For He does not afflict willingly / Or grieve the children of men.
The crushing under his foot / Of all the prisoners of the earth,
The turning aside of the justice due a man / Before the face of the Most High,
The wronging of a man in his cause--/ Will not the Lord see all these?
Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, / What the Lord has not commanded?
Out of the mouth of the Most High / Do there not proceed evil things and something good?
Why does a living man complain, / A man for the punishment of his sins?
Let us examine our ways and try them, / And let us turn again to Jehovah.
Let us lift up our heart with our hands / Unto God in the heavens.
We have transgressed and rebelled; / You have not pardoned.
You have covered Yourself with anger and have pursued us; / You have slain; You have not spared.
You have covered Yourself with a cloud / That prayer might not pass through.
You have made us offscouring and refuse / In the midst of the peoples.
All our enemies have opened / Their mouths against us.
Fear and the pit are upon us, / Devastation and destruction.
My eye runs down with streams of water / For the destruction of the daughter of my people.
My eye pours forth and does not stop; / There is no cessation,
Until Jehovah looks down / And sees from the heavens.
My eye pains my soul / Because of all the daughters of my city.
They have hunted me down like a bird, / They who are my enemies without cause.
They have brought my life to its end in the pit / And have thrown a stone upon me.
Water streamed over my head; / I said, I have been cut off.
I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, / From the lowest pit.
You have heard my voice; do not hide / Your ear at my breathing, at my cry.
You drew near in the day that I called upon You; / You said, Do not fear.
Lord, You have pleaded my soul's case; / You have redeemed my life.
You have seen, O Jehovah, my oppression; / Judge my cause.
You have seen all their vengeance, / All their plans, against me.
You have heard their reproach, O Jehovah, / All their plans against me,
The lips of those who rise up against me / And their meditation against me all the day.
Look upon their sitting down and their rising up; / I am their mocking song.
You will render to them a recompense, O Jehovah, / According to the work of their hands.
You will give them hardness of heart; / Your curse be upon them.
You will pursue them in anger and will destroy them / From under the heavens of Jehovah.
