Remember, O Jehovah, what has come upon us; / Look and see our reproach.
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, / Our houses to foreigners.
We are orphans without father; / Our mothers are like widows.
We have drunk our water for money; / Our wood comes to us at a price.
On our necks are our pursuers; / We are weary; we have no rest.
We have given our hand to Egypt / And to Assyria, so as to be satisfied with bread.
Our fathers sinned and they are not, / And we ourselves bear their iniquities.
Slaves rule over us; / There is no one to deliver us from their hand.
We get our bread at the risk of our lives / Because of the sword from the wilderness.
Our skin is black like an oven / Because of the burning heat of famine.
They have ravished the women in Zion, / The virgins in the cities of Judah.
Princes were hanged by them. / The faces of the elders were not honored.
The young men bore the mill, / And the young boys stumbled under the wood.
The old men have ceased from the gate, / The young men from their music.
The joy of our heart has ceased; / Our dance has been turned into mourning.
The crown has fallen from our head. / Woe to us! For we have sinned.
Because of this our heart is faint; / Because of these things our eyes are dim;
Because of Mount Zion, which is desolate--/ Foxes rove in it.
You, O Jehovah, abide forever; / Your throne is from generation to generation.
Why do You forget us forever / And forsake us for so long a time?
Turn us back to You, O Jehovah, and we will be turned; / Renew our days as before.
Or have You utterly rejected us? / Are You exceedingly angry with us?
