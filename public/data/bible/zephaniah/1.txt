The word of Jehovah that came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, the king of Judah.
I will utterly remove everything / From off the face of the earth, / Declares Jehovah.
I will remove man and beast; / I will remove the birds of heaven and the fish of the sea, / And the stumbling blocks with the wicked; / And I will cut off man / From the face of the earth, / Declares Jehovah.
And I will stretch out My hand against Judah / And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, / And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, / And the name of the idol priests with the priests,
And those who worship upon the housetops / The host of heaven, / And the worshippers who swear to Jehovah / And swear by Malcam,
And those who have been turned back from going after Jehovah / And have not sought Jehovah / And have not inquired of Him.
Be silent before the Lord Jehovah, / For the day of Jehovah is near; / For Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice; / He has consecrated those whom He has called.
And in the day of the sacrifice of Jehovah / I will punish the princes / And the sons of the king / And all who wear / The clothing of foreigners.
And in that day I will punish / All who leap over the threshold, / Who fill their master's house / With violence and deceit.
And in that day, declares Jehovah, / There will be the sound of an outcry from the Fish Gate / And wailing from the second district / And a great crashing from the hills.
Wail, O inhabitants of Maktesh, / For all the people of Canaan are destroyed, / All who are laden with silver are cut off.
And at that time I will search through Jerusalem with lamps, / And I will punish the men / Who have settled on their lees, / Who say in their heart, / Jehovah will not do good, / Nor will He do evil.
And their wealth will become plunder, / And their houses, a desolation. / Indeed they will build houses but not inhabit them, / And they will plant vineyards but not drink the wine from them.
The great day of Jehovah is near; / It is near and hastens greatly. / The sound of the day of Jehovah! / The mighty man bitterly cries there.
That day is a day of overflowing wrath, / A day of trouble and distress, / A day of waste and ruin, / A day of darkness and gloom, / A day of clouds and deep darkness,
A day of trumpet and alarm / Against the fortified cities / And against the high battlements.
And I will bring distress upon the men, / So that they walk about like the blind, / For they have sinned against Jehovah; / And their blood will be poured out like dust, / And their bowels like dung.
Neither their silver nor their gold / Will be able to deliver them / In the day of the overflowing wrath of Jehovah; / But the whole land will be devoured by the fire of His jealousy, / For He will make an end, nothing other than sudden destruction, / Of all the inhabitants of the land.
