Woe to the rebellious and defiled one, / To the oppressing city!
She has not listened to the voice; / She has not taken the correction. / She has not trusted in Jehovah; / She has not drawn near to her God.
Her princes in the midst of her / Are roaring lions. / Her judges are wolves of the evening; / They have left nothing until the morning.
Her prophets are vainglorious; / They are men of treachery. / Her priests have defiled the sanctuary; / They have done violence to the law.
Jehovah is righteous in the midst of her; / He does no wrong; / Morning by morning He brings His justice to light; / He does not fail; but he who is wrong knows no shame.
I have cut off nations; / Their battlements are desolated; / I have made their streets a waste, / So that no one passes through; / Their cities are destroyed, / So that there is no one, / So that there is no inhabitant.
I said, Only fear Me; / Take the correction; / That her habitation might not be cut off, / According to all that I have appointed concerning her. / But they rose up early to corrupt / All their deeds.
Therefore wait on Me, declares Jehovah, / For the day when I rise up to the prey. / For My decision is to assemble the nations, / To gather kingdoms together, / That I may pour out upon them My wrath, / All My burning anger; / For in the fire of My jealousy / All the earth will be devoured.
For then I will change the language of the peoples / Into a pure language / That they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, / To serve Him with one accord.
From beyond the rivers of Cush My suppliants, / The daughter of My dispersed, will bring My meal offering.
In that day you will not be put to shame because of all your deeds, / By which you have transgressed against Me; / For then I will take away from your midst / Those who exult in your majesty, / And you will never again be haughty / On My holy mountain.
And I will leave in the midst of you / An afflicted and poor people, / And they will take refuge in the name of Jehovah.
The remnant of Israel will not do wrong; / And they will not speak lies, / Nor will there be found in their mouth / A deceitful tongue; / For they will have pasture and lie down, / And there will be no one to frighten them.
Give a ringing shout, O daughter of Zion! / Shout in triumph, O Israel! / Rejoice and exult with all your heart, / O daughter of Jerusalem!
Jehovah has taken away your judgments; / He has turned aside your enemy. / The King of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of you; / You will not see evil again.
In that day it will be said to Jerusalem, / Fear not, O Zion; / Let not your hands drop.
Jehovah your God in the midst of you / Is a mighty One who saves; / He will be jubilant over you with rejoicing; / He will rest in His love; / He will exult over you with a ringing shout.
I will gather those who mourn for the appointed assembly, / Who were of you. / The reproach was a burden upon them.
Indeed at that time / I will deal with all who afflict you; / And I will save that which is lame, / And that which has been driven away I will gather. / And I will make them a praise and a name / In every land where their shame had been.
At that time I will bring you in, / And at that time I will gather you; / For I will cause you to be a name and a praise / Among all the peoples of the earth, / When I turn again your captivity before your eyes, / Says Jehovah.
