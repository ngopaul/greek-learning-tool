Gather yourselves together, yes, gather, / O nation that has no shame,
Before the decree has effect, / (The day passes like chaff) / Before there comes upon you / The burning anger of Jehovah, / Before there comes upon you / The day of Jehovah's anger.
Seek Jehovah, / All you meek of the earth, / Who have performed His judgments. / Seek righteousness; / Seek meekness; / Perhaps you will be hidden / In the day of Jehovah's anger.
For Gaza will be a forsaken city, / And Ashkelon will become a desolation; / As for Ashdod, they will drive it out at noontime, / And Ekron will be rooted up.
Woe to you inhabitants of the seacoast, / O nation of Cherethites! / The word of Jehovah is against you, / O Canaan, O land of the Philistines: / I will destroy you so that there will be no inhabitant.
And the seacoast will be pastures with shepherds' caves / And folds for flocks.
And the area will be / For the remnant of the house of Judah; / They will feed their flocks upon them. / In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down in the evening, / For Jehovah their God will visit them / And turn again their captivity.
I have heard the reproaching of Moab / And the revilings of the children of Ammon, / By which they have reproached My people / And magnified themselves against their border.
Therefore as I live, / Declares Jehovah of hosts, / The God of Israel, / Moab will surely be like Sodom, / And the children of Ammon like Gomorrah, / A possession of scrubs / And salt pits / And a perpetual desolation; / The remnant of My people will spoil them, / And the residue of My nation will inherit them.
This will they have for their pride, for they reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.
Jehovah will be terrible to them, for He will make all the gods of the earth vanish, and all the coastlands of the nations will worship Him, each from his own place.
You Cushites also / Will be slain by My sword.
And He will stretch out His hand against the north / And will destroy Assyria, / And will make Nineveh a desolation / And a desert, like the wilderness.
And herds will stretch out in the midst of her, / And animals of every kind; / Both the pelican and the porcupine / Will lodge in her capitals. / Their voice will sing in the windows; / Desolation is upon the threshold; / For He has laid the cedar work bare.
This is the jubilant city / That dwelt securely, / That said in her heart, I am, / And there is none besides me. / How she has become a desolation, / A place for animals to stretch out! / Everyone who passes by her will hiss / And wave his hand at her.
