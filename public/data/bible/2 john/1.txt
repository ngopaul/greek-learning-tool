The elder to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in truthfulness, and not only I but also all those who know the truth,
For the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:
Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.
And now I ask you, lady, not as writing a new commandment to you but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.
And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you walk in love.
For many deceivers went out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
Look to yourselves that you do not lose the things which we wrought, but that you may receive a full reward.
Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!
For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works.
Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink, but I am hoping to be with you and to speak face to face that our joy may be made full.
The children of your chosen sister greet you.
