# OpenGNT / RcV Greek Text Differences
This file lists the differences between the OpenGNT and RcV greek texts. The RcV New Testament largely follows Nestle-Aland 26th Edition.

| OpenGNT book/chaptera/verse/word (s) | RcV book/chapter/verse/word (s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 47/13/12,47/13/12 | 47/13/12,47/13/13,47/13/14 | 2 Corinthians 13:12 (OpenGNT) is split into two verses in RcV, that is, into 13:12 and 13:13. 2 Cor. 13:13 in OpenGNT is 2 Cor. 13:14 in RcV. |
| 49/4/16/14 | 49/4/16/14 | Ephesians 4:16 word 14 in most MSS is κατ, but RcV uses Papyrus 45: και "and (through)", not "according to". The building up of the Body of Christ is not simply similar to the operation in the measure of each one part, but the joining and knitting through the operation |
